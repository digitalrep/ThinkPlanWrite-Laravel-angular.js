(NULL,NULL,1,'Ghosting','2016-04-09 20:56:50','2016-04-09 20:56:50','​On the issue of \'why men ghost\' - it could be for a much more complex reason than we commonly think. A lot of women could be in the position of thinking that they want a long term, stable relationship with a man, when in actual fact, deep down inside, they want nothing of the sort. \r\n\r\nWhat would a person in this position do, a person with conflicting goals? They would probably make every outward appearance of attempting to satisfy the socially acceptable goal whilst also self sabotaging. They could do this by pushing men away - and in turn this can be done in a number of various ways. A woman could set up a bunch of conditions within the courtship ritual that simply could never be met. In this way she is by all appearances creating ways for the suitor to win her over - yet he can never quite hit the mark. \r\n\r\nAnother way for her to successfully self sabotage would be to set up vague or ambiguous conditions that, while technically being met by the suitor, always fail to hit the mark due to being badly or erroneously determined. And thus the suitor, realising that he hasn\'t met the conditions, asks what he did wrong, and then attempts once again to fill the requirements only to fail yet again due to even more erroneously determined conditions and in the end comes to the conclusion that he can\'t win and so decides to give up, which gives the woman what she secretly wants yet outwardly leaves her with an unmet goal. In this way she is able to take on the role of the helpless victim: I set out to attain something and failed due to my needs consistently not being met. Even though deep down she knows she didn\'t really give anyone a chance to properly meet them. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately while temporarily satisfying for her the woman is left unable to move forward because she can\'t face the truth that she doesn\'t actually want this goal to be met so she is doomed to repeat the cycle again and again and again. Instinctively the suitor senses that the woman doesn\'t really want to be won over and the easiest way for him to exit is to leave without a trace because his pride is hurt and if he confronts the situation only to find a new set of requirements that he can\'t possibly meet he finds him self stuck in a cycle also where he can\'t fulfil the requirements either and so it\'s easier for him to just leave and give her what she wants which is to be the victim.', 444),

Her intuition was screaming at her to run away from him as fast as she could. There was something about him that was bad, something terribly wrong. But she couldn\'t quite pinpoint exactly what it was.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning she had felt that something was off - she couldn\'t shake the feeling that he just didn\'t like her all that much. The more she spent time with him, the more the feeling persisted, and in the end it never left her with a moment\'s peace. It was like a stubborn cough that tickled at the throat throughout the day at random intervals, always making its presence known and never able to be relieved. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning she questioned him about it - asked him - did he like her? And he would reassure her, and tell her yes, he did, but his actions simply never matched his words and that is why she never believed it. In the end he wouldn\'t bother reassuring her, instead he would simply fly into a rage and start attacking her.\r\n\r\nThey had met at a cafe in St Kilda to have coffee. She had noticed that he had quickly grown bored with her as soon as she began speaking on a topic of her own choosing. He tended to gaze off into the distance until she had finished, changing the topic to something completely different. It left her with the impression that he was wholly uninterested in what she had just said. When he wasn\'t doing that he simply remained silent. She found the silence worse than the change of topic. It was a long, invalidating kind of silence, the kind that felt strangely familiar - in fact, it felt so famililar because her mother had a tendency towards the same kinds of silences. \r\n\r\nWhen she spoke to her mother on the phone or even in person, she got the distinct feeling that she was being burdonsome to her, that her mother viewed her as something to be endured in order to obtain some unknown end result rather than something to be enjoyed. And this man was making her feel the exact same way. \r\n\r\nSadly, at the time, she had chalked it up to him having nerves. This was partly due to the fact that he had spoken about his anxiety at making people feel \'awkward\'. He had said that he was too \'stuck inside his own head\'. Maybe, maybe not...\r\n\r\nBut signs of his disinterest in her as a person only continued from that point forward. On their second date he spent a great deal of time telling her about the other women in their shared social circles that he had asked out or was currently talking to. He also stiffed her on dinner in the most obnoxious way - he had set the date for six, and they were going to see a movie - only at the very last minute he had messaged her to say that he intended on getting there half an hour early to stuff a burger down his throat. She was, of course, welcome to join him if she liked. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, rather than answering him politely with, \"Oh, I thought we were going to have dinner together?\" Which would have been the appropriate thing to do, she swallowed her disappointment and replied with, \"Okay I\'ll see you there.\" Then, five minutes before he arrived she suddenly felt her true feelings and got angry at him. She didn\'t want to show him this anger though so instead she sent a message saying, \"I\'ll leave you to eat dinner. I\'ve changed my mind about the movie.\" Unfortunately he ran into her as she was making her exit and so she couldn\'t avoid the situation. \r\n\r\nThings just went from bad to worse from then on. They went to his apartment where he told her that he had recently witnessed an eighty year old woman being taken out of her house on a stretcher. He didn\'t want to die that way - alone. Having abandoned the movie altogether they ended up almost sleeping together. They were kissing and touching, and it got quite heated; eventually he told her that he got the feeling that she just wanted to be fucked. She told him she wanted them to get to know each other. He was poised above her and she could see the desire in his eyes. She kept staring back at him, waiting to see what he would do. She wasn\'t going to give him the green light to go ahead. Already she was beginning to dislike him. Still, she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he was just stupid and that\'s why he talked about other women he wanted in front of her. Maybe his sudden disinterest whenever she spoke was just social anxiety. Maybe he didn\'t just decide to start something with her from a fear of dying alone. Maybe this excuse, maybe that excuse. \r\n\r\nThe reality was that she was sick of being single, sick of being alone, and anything at that point would have been better. Even being with an emotional abuser. \r\n\r\nLooking back at that moment she wished that she had just slept with him then and that he had promptly lost interest in her afterwards. It would have been less painful than the pain she had come to endure from him from that point on. \r\n\r\nWhen they next saw each other they went to a cafe in his suburb on his lunchbreak - she drove there - even though she had an appointment soon afterwards to get to, and it seemed to her that she was making most of the effort for this guy, and hey, if he actually liked her, shouldn\'t he be trying to see her and not the other way around - and then they walked to the cafe which was way out of her price range. He told her that his friends had warned him against her when he had told them that she didn\'t currently have a job. She felt quite put down by that. He of course said he didn\'t care at all. However she distinctly felt that it was as if he was trying to let her know that she wasn\'t quite good enough for him. \r\n\r\nHe wanted to eat in front of her. She explained that the place was simply out of her price range - she couldn\'t afford to spend twenty dollars on bacon and eggs. In fact, she rarely spent money on restuarnt or cafe food. It wasn\'t in her nature to do so. They passed a bakery on the way back to his apartment. She made a mistake then. She supposed she was still smarting about the put down at her not having a job and him so magnanimously not caring about it. She confided to him that her ex hadn\'t exactly been Brad Pitt, but she had loved him anyway; in essence, that looks weren\'t the most important thing for her. It was more about how someone treated her than how good he looked. \r\n\r\nIronically he never really did treat her that well anyway. \r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, after they had slept together, he found reasons to bring up Justin Bieber; in particular, a song which had the lyrics, \"If you like the way you look so much then baby you should go and love yourself.\" She even heard him singing it in her presence on more than one occasion. Once he even wanted to play it. She declined. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, while with him, she was responsible for 100% of her orgasms.\r\n\r\nHe often accused her of holding onto resentments. She found that quite amusing. He was hands-down the most resentful person she had ever met. \r\n\r\nHe bought her dinner at Grilld, which was great - but then made a joke about how easy she was as all it took to get her into bed was to buy her a cheeseburger.\r\n\r\nOnce they had slept together the criticisms came thick and fast. Not only that, he expected her to wait on him, to cook for him while he lazed around on the couch or played video games, like she was his mother or something. He even took calls in her presence because talking to her, having a conversation with her and engaging with her clearly was the last thing he wanted to do. \r\n\r\nUnless he was criticising her or lecturing her. Then he was suddenly interested in talking - well, talking at her, not really to her. But if she began to talk about something she liked, suddenly he would want to practice mindfulness or meditate. In other words, anything other than have a conversation with her. \r\n\r\nShe started trying to point out to him that he just didn\'t like her that much. For some strange reason he wouldn\'t admit to it. \r\n\r\nHe told her that he didn\'t want to introduce her to his parents or his grandparents or in fact anyone in his family. That hurt her feelings. She told him that she didn\'t want to meet them anyway but was confused as to why he would say that to her in the first place. After all, they had only known each other two weeks, if that. It was too early to meet each others family. \r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that he enjoyed putting her down, any chance he got, even if nonsensically.  \r\n\r\nHe started to project his ex girlfriend\'s personality onto her. When she tried to get him to see that he just didn\'t like her all that much he claimed that she was \'pushing him away\' and that \'he wouldn\'t abandon her\'. While this was flattering for her she didn\'t really find it all that relevant but stayed with him anyway in the hopes that one day he would stop being so mean to her. That never happened. \r\n\r\nIf she ever tried to point out how mean he was being to her he would tell her she was being:\r\nDramatic\r\nToo sensitive\r\nTaking things too personally\r\n\r\nOne day she touched his chest as she was talking to him - he went into a frenzy saying that he didn\'t like to be hit or poked. She apologised and endeavoured not to do it again. Whenever he crossed her boundaries, though, she was expected just to put up with it. He asked to put a soiled condom in her car. She said no. He kept trying to put it in there anwyay. Afterwards he acted like she was the unreasonable one despite the fact that he clearly had double standards about boundaries being crossed. \r\n\r\nHe accused her of wanting to cheat on him with a man from his al anon group, a man she had never met. He asked her if she had been drinking one day. She didn\'t drink. He often forgot conversations they had had - obviously she wasn\'t that important to him; due to his lack of interest in talking to her, their conversations were few and far between, so she would think that he would remember the two or three they had actually had. He didn\'t though. Obviously she didn\'t even factor on his radar at all. \r\n\r\nOnce he even made her cry - he was that mean to her - and when he saw it he told her that sometimes when someone shows you kindness after not having known it, it causes tears. This made her cry even harder. She wanted so badly to tell him that sometimes you cry because the man you like doesn\'t like you at all; he comes into your house, criticises it and everything about you, then has sex with you and wants to leave directly afterwards. And it hurts. It also hurts when he dismisses everything you feel as being \'dramatic\' and doesn\'t take your concerns seriously. But he wouldn\'t have heard it. \r\n\r\nOnce they had had sex and she had given him head during the foreplay, and then he had wanted to have sex again and had tried to make her give him oral sex again and she had declined, he accused her of being selfish. \r\n\r\nHe even picked on her anatomy. \r\n\r\nHe thought he knew more than a psychiatrist. He denied she had a mental illness that she had formally been diagnosed with - imagine that, she didn\'t even have the right to have a mental illness in his eyes. In his eyes, she was simply character flawed. Unbelievable. \r\n\r\nWhen she brought up to him again that the relationship wasn\'t really that great, and that after every time she saw him she felt like crap because he was so incredibly mean to her, he said he didn\'t want to hurt her by ending it. HAHAHA! He said it with a straight face. She assured him that it certainly wouldn\'t hurt her. He deduced that she was cold and heartless. \r\n\r\nWhat he didn\'t understand is that she couldn\'t possibly love someone that was so mean to her. So uninterested in her. So resentful and selfish. \r\n\r\nShe realised she could walk out onto the main street right near his apartment, right then, and within an hour (maybe even less) she could probably find a man her age, single, attractive and successful who was willing to treat her better than he had been treating her. With respect. With dignity. With admiration. With friendship. With compassion. \r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she felt terribly sorry for him, because obviously he has never known a truly loving, supportive relationship and how good it feels to be in one, because if he had, he wouldn\'t settle for anything less. \r\n\r\nShe had to write this in this way because he never allowed her to defend herself against him. He would raise his voice, cut her off, dismiss her opinion, tell her she was being dramatic, call her names, etc. So this was literally THE ONLY WAY she could have her say. \r\n\r\nHe was an emotional abuser. She was prone to outbursts of rage, she was paranoid at times and suffered from anxiety, but in no way was she deserving of the way he treated her. Not at all. \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nNow that she\'s thought about it for a while, several new things come to light. \r\n\r\n1. Demanding things from men doesn\'t work - only if they\'re really weak men. If they are more dominant types they just get fed up, angry, or think you\'re high maintenance and leave. \r\n2. Nagging isn\'t great either; it\'s slightly better than demanding but again a lot of men don\'t respond to it. \r\n3. She grew up in a home with a mother whose only way of asking for things was to demand them. She had no other mode of operation. \r\n\r\nOther people use different tactics to get what they wantâ ¦\r\n - they use guilt \r\n - reverse psychology \r\n - they use compassion\r\n - they use love / affection etc <-- she could probably do this one\r\n - they ask nicely \r\n - they act weak and helpless \r\n - they act pouty and childlike \r\n\r\nHowever, even if she were to change the way she asks for things, he is still going to call her \'selfish\' when she doesn\'t want to give him a headjob, and still going to want to be selfish and sit around playing video games and ignoring her / not talking to her / not paying attention to her when she\'s there unless it\'s for sex; in other words, if she gives an inch he\'ll take a mile. \r\n\r\nShe really just doesn\'t know how to get what she wants from men. Expecting them to just give it to her is naive, isn\'t it? How many men are going to be the perfect partner, really? So it stands to reason that there has to be a way to get stuff out of them. \r\n\r\nBut she still think this one obviously hates her. And she thinks he\'s in abuse mode now and that\'s not going to change because abusers don\'t get less abusive, do they? They either keep up a steady effort or get more abusive. \r\n\r\nThe other thing is how do you maintain boundaries with people who overstep them and then don\'t acknowledge that they\'ve overstepped them? \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nI am an abuser\'s dream.\r\n\r\nNot only do I feel right at home placating an angry, abusive person, but I give them the perfect justification for being angry in the first place.\r\n\r\nBecause my mother only knew of two ways to get what she wanted - demanding it or throwing an angry tantrum like a three year old, I am prone to demanding what I want and throwing angry tantrums when I don\'t get it. Abusers would love this - when I demand, they withhold. When they withhold, I go into tantrum mode. When I go into tantrum mode, the abuser now has the perfect justication for being abusive - AND - added bonus for them - I am programmed to respond perfectly to their angry abuse. \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe viciousness in himâ ¦ A lot of men wouldn\'t react that way. If someone was asking something from them that they didn\'t want to give, they wouldn\'t get vicious. A lot of men would simply walk away, fade out. A lot of men would explain themselves calmly and logically, analysing the situation and where things were going wrong. They wouldn\'t beome vicious, turning on a dime. They wouldn\'t suddenly go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. \r\n\r\nImagine a guy like that with a child. He would be like that angry old grandpa at the park when the granddaughter was crying. \"Why are you ruining this day for us? Stop being so selfish.\" What a horrible man. What damage he is inflicting upon an innocent child. What a travesty. \r\n\r\nIt\'s not a quality I want in a partner, that\'s for sure. I couldn\'t imagine spending too much time with someone like that. Especially when they can\'t even pay me the courtesy of listening to me while I speak. Especially when they see fit to shut me down all the time and won\'t allow me to have opinions or thoughts or feelings about things. They wouldn\'t allow me to be a person. \r\n\r\nI would basically just be a sex and affection vending machine for them. Maybe that\'s what they want. All they have to do is push the right buttons and insert the right amount of coins and they can get what they want conveniently dispensed. When the machine starts rambling on (talking about something its interested in) they can just walk away and ignore it. When the machine expresses and opinion, thought or feeling that they don\'t like, just shut it down. Come back later when you need something again and turn it on again, insert coins, push buttons. Rinse and repeat. Too easy. \r\n\r\nNow that I ruminate on it some more, the question arises: do men get to just ask for what they want in relationships? And if so, are women more than willing to give it? And if so, why aren\'t women afforded the same right? Why do men fly into a perilous rage when women dare to ask for something they want?', 3198),

Her shoulders would slump and her eyes would grow suddenly very tired looking, and her mouth would droop. She was like a candle that burned more brightly the more it was beheld. When no one was looking it would fizzle out. \r\n\r\nSue was one of a common breed of women who absolutely loved to be catty - the cattier the better, in fact - however, heaven forbid anyone ever call her out on it; her ego protected her from it, casting a protective shawl over bitchiness so that it only came out in very subversive ways. In this way Sue never need even be aware of the fact that she was an absolute cow.\r\n\r\nElla imagined that she targeted women she felt threatened by - Ella herself couldn\'t understand this, though, as she quickly acknowledged any ill feelings she had towards other women and let them pass her by. She refused to be so petty. But Sue lived for pettiness. The moment she met Ella she felt threatened. By what, Ella could only guess - Ella wasn\'t bad looking; she wasn\'t a supermodel or anything. It could be that, however Ella thought Sue herself was quite good looking. It could have been Ella\'s talent and proficiency at her job - although the two were in different fields so she doubted it was that. Ella was thinner than Sue, it was probably that. \r\n\r\nSue liked to pretend she was talking about one thing when in actuality they were just thinly veiled insults. One could be mistaken, the first time they heard Sue talk, into thinking that Sue was actually talking about the subject matter she was discussing, but when one was exposed to Sue time and time again one began to realise that the woman was just using her favourite topics as delivery vehicles for her snide remarks.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Sue pretended she was talking about a swimming centre in her suburb. \"The only problem with it is this skirting they use around the edges of the change rooms. I hate it, it\'s too long.\" At first \r\n\r\nElla truly felt as though every movement the woman made, and the way in which she spoke every word, every facial expression she made, and every turn of phrase she used was somehow already imprinted in her mind. Every time the woman said or did something it would cause some neurons to fire at the part of her brain that recognised intimate prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nElla wondered at this - she was absolutely certain she did not know this woman. Prior to this meeting they had never seen one another.\r\n\r\nThe only valid explanation Ella could come up with for this feeling that plagued her was that Bill, having met Sue before, must have described the woman in such perfect detail that he had painted the most vivid portrait of her in Ella\'s mind, and Ella had simply forgotten all about it. Yes, that must be it. She felt some measure of relief at this conclusion. She could easily double-check it with Bill later. ', 737),
(NULL,NULL,3,'Craig is Mean','2016-04-23 20:56:50','2016-05-18 01:24:05','Ella disliked dealing with Craig. She couldn’t shake the feeling that he just didn’t like her for whatever reason. Ella couldn’t really be a hundred percent sure why without coming right out and asking him, and even then, he definitely wouldn’t admit to it, however, she suspected it was because when they had first met she simply hadn’t acted suitably impressed with him. \r\n \r\nShe had taken over his old position of project manager, the position he had willingly stepped down from in order to become the new QA manager. He had introduced himself to her as an ex olympic ski jump athlete who had won bronze twice before going on to attend Melbourne University, graduating second from the top of the class, before finally joining the company. Ella had made the mistake of responding with, “Oh, bronze twice, huh? Is that why you gave it up?” \r\n\r\nShe had supposed later on after the fact upon further reflection that her response hadn’t quite been the zealous praise and admiration he had been looking for. She was, at times, mildly socially retarded, and if she could have taken that moment back and redone it she would have; however, she simply couldn’t, and even though she had been working there and trying to make it up to him for six years, she still felt that he hated her. \r\n\r\nHe had, from the word go, taken to explaining his particular thoughts regarding the undertaking of every single aspect of the role she now held in painstaking detail. She had persevered with this tedious advice with the polite patience of a psychologist and when he had finally finished she had told him that she would definitely take what he had said on board; however, she really didn’t think she’d have been hired unless Bill thought she was up to the job. He hadn’t seemed happy with that at all. \r\n\r\nSince then, having realised that she’d inadvertently severely wounded his ego, she had tried to overcompensate by being unnaturally nice to him, but even extending a baseline level of courtesy to someone like Craig was a taxing affair in and of itself let alone going above and beyond for him, and while she had tried her very best, it would seem that perhaps no matter how nice she was, she would never reach the level of niceness that he now seemed to require from her for things between them to be \'okay\'. Needless to say, Craig was and always had been her number one source of job-related angst. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t even the one-on-one interactions with him that had the most devastating effect on her - when in a group situation, such as when people loitered around waiting for the lift at the end of the day, or in the kitchen at morning tea, or even in the quiet moments just before a meeting was called to order, he had a habit of laughing a lot when she was around, and it wasn’t a throaty, gregarious kind of laugh, either; it was that soft, arrogant kind of laugh that was barely audible, yet still definitely recognisable as a sneer. \r\n\r\nThose moments when he would sneer at her constantly always put Ella on edge. He just about always failed to laugh at things she would expect someone to laugh at - her attempts at jokes, for example, that other people would laugh at politely simply to break the awkwardness, even if they weren’t that funny. At those moments, Craig wouldn’t make a sound. \r\n\r\nBut at other moments that rude little sneer would suddenly make its appearance; usually it would turn up directly following occurrences that weren’t really funny at all but in some way made her look bad. For example, it showed up once when she had gone to put her coffee cup down on the meeting room table before sitting down and a splash of coffee had swished its way up and over the inner edge of the cup and then down and onto her skirt in a rather embarrassing spot. It had showed up another time wheb she had accidentally misquoted a figure during the meeting - and then again when she had apologised - and then once more when she had stammered due to being thrown off by all the sneering. Another time someone had asked her a question and she had been so absorbed in reading the notes before her that she hadn’t realised she had been addressed - another sneer - and another when she had subsequently apologised and another when she hadn’t been able to answer the question. Another time she was last into the lift and just as the doors were closing someone had wanted in but she hadn\'t been able to hit the lift door open button in time - and of course, had been right there sneering at her expense like he always did as though it was totally appropriate for him to behave in that way. It was unnerving. \r\n\r\nWhen she had first encountered the sneering Ella had imagined that Craig was just dreadfully shy, but as she was exposed to him and the awful sneering more and more she came to realise that he was just plain old mean, and she seemed to be his number one target. She often wondered who he had targeted before she had arrived, if anyone at all. \r\n\r\nHe certainly never targeted any men in the office that she knew about - not their shared superiors nor the men working directly underneath him in his team. However, when the sandwich girl or the massage lady visited the office, the sneer would suddenly come out of hiding again, renewed with vigor after having had a period of respite while he had been surrounded solely by men.\r\n\r\nSometimes Ella liked to daydream about revenge... She would be in the kitchen eating, and in he would come, and it would be just the two of them, and he would spot the box of donuts on the table. She would bide her time and wait until he was in the process of biting into a donut and then do something mildly embarrassing, like spill coffee on her blouse or stub her toe, and at that precise moment, when the piece of donut was right at the back of his throat, just about to be swallowed, he would go to sneer at her and begin choking as the piece of donut went down the wrong passage. He would grab at his throat as he was turning blue, gesticulating wildly, the hue of his suffocating skin making his red hair stand out even more than it usually did, and his eyes would be upon her then, imploring her to help him, his face for once rid of that arrogant expression of smugness and now replaced with one that was made up of a more attractive mixture of equal parts terror and humility. And even though she knew in her heart that if she saved his life it would probably be the one thing that would finally elevate her status in his eyes, it would not be enough to compel her to help the bastard. She wouldn\'t watch him choke, exactly; she didn\'t need to witness the violence of it, she just wouldn\'t make a move to prevent it. \r\n\r\nThat daydream was particularly useful after interactions with Craig and it made her smile to herself so widely and so joyously that other people in the office would give her a quizzical look, wondering what it was she was grinning to herself at like an idiot about. \r\n\r\nIf Craig had been there at those times he would sneer at her. /', 1280),

For some deeply rooted and  dysfunctional reason she felt the need to not only point out to the man what he was doing wrong, but also to have him admit to not only what he was doing but the reasons why. She would lay it all out in front of him like a hand of solitaire that was one or two moves from being completed - here, she would say, you don\'t really feel for me, and that is the reason you can be so cruel. Move the King of Spades up to the stack and then place the King that was underneath it on the stack and we’ll be done. Unfortunately, the man would not play, for solitaire is a solitary pursuit and one cannot simply ask another to complete the end of one’s game. One must start and finish one’s own game, going through the whole process themselves, otherwise it seems a pointless waste of time. \r\n\r\nAnd so it would continue, her becoming increasingly more and more wounded and victimised, and he growing more and more brave with his vindictiveness, unleashing it whenever she didn\'t want to give him a blow job, or when he wanted to see a different movie than she did, or when she left an unwashed dish in his sink, until she was forced, in a final moment of pain, to unleash the most extravagant act of viciousness so as to really force him to end it, and so that she  could feel as though she had done all that she could to turn him, to win him over to her side, but despite her best efforts she had failed. \r\n\r\nThe Internet was riddled with stories of people like this; they were labelled narcissists, borderlines...

Unfortunately she had to pass about five of them because the gym she had signed up for was three suburbs over. She had chosen it specifically for its state of the art facilities - it boasted several saunas and spas as well as an olympic sized pool, none of which she had ever utilised even once during her two year membership. She might as well have chosen the gym closest to her apartment, the one near the supermarket that was run by the short middle aged man who always wore a dark navy coloured tracksuit with red detailing and gold chains around his neck. He had seemed a little dodgy when she had spoken to him about a membership at his gym - she had declined when she had realised that it would take a better exit strategy than [reference to some war thing] to get out of. He had offered her a good deal, though, and what with the monthly rate she was currently paying and the commute time wasted to get there she felt quite the fool for not having taken it. \r\n\r\nThe gym itself was always such a blatant meat market. Men would always strut about it so deliberately slowly, like oversized raindrops trailing down a window pane. They were so desperate for any female attention. And the women there were thoroughly over-examined and so they shut down completely, keeping their eyes front at all times like soldiers marching in a [soldier parade thingy]. The whole atmosphere made her uncomfortable. She was older than most of the women she saw there, and this was both a blessing and a curse. If an attractive woman happened upon a treadmill next to her she would get caught in the crossfire of men\'s gazes. This was just a painful reminder of the lack of gazes that were thrown her way those days and always tended to put her in a weird, forced kind of mood. On some days she would take some power back and throw some attention over at the strutting young men out of pity. They would be so incredibly grateful at this act of kindness that they would strut about even more and then things would get slightly uncomfortable, and so she eventually stopped doing it. She was always kind towards the young women who seemed so terrified and restrained - cracking a joke with them or simply smiling at them seemed to break down their walls and allow them some relief. \r\n\r\nShe sorely wished to retire from the gym altogether, to find a mate and breed and finally be allowed to fatten up, or at least, to have a valid excuse to fatten up, to be put out to pasture already.

His body looked unnatural, kind of like a ragdoll, its limbs askance and its torso twisted oddly. His skull had been partially crushed - his head was on its side, and it looked as though he had an ear to the ground, listening intently, except that only one eye, one ear and half a mouth remained intact on his face. Quite a bit of blood was now pooling around his body, filling the cracks in the sidewalk before slowly expanding outwards. Ella was beside herself. She alternated between standing above him and staring disbelievingly down at him, desperately willing him to get up, and crouching down beside him to reach a hand out to gingerly touch his soft, sandy coloured hair. How she loved to stroke his hair as he lay his head on her shoulder or leaned in to kiss her. She sobbed uncontrollably. Reality was setting in. He was the love of her life. It had taken her 35 years to find him and now he was gone. Just like that. A security guard suddenly appeared. He had been drawn out into the night from his rounds inside by the alarm of Ella\'s frantic wailing. When he saw the body up close he involuntarily let out a sickened cry. He brought his hand to his mouth as he swallowed back the sudden onslaught of bile that had risen to his throat. When it had settled he spoke into his radio. \"Aashir, someone\'s jumped from the top of the building. You better call the police.... Christ. You should see this.\" His eyes were transfixed on Drew\'s crushed, bleeding body for such a long time that he completely forgot about Ella, until her sobbing reached such an intolerable pitch that he was forced to finally turn his head and acknowledge her. She had fallen to her knees, having backed up a full metre away from her lover, driven away from his body by the ever expanding patch of blood surrounding it.

There there.\" Her sobbing quieted but she began to shake as she lost control of her body. She stared up at the building where she worked, at its many shiny, soul-less window eyes that seemed to glare right back at her, as if watching her every move. She looked back at Drew.

The strong, sophisticated, independent career woman who was always practical, the woman who always kept her emotions in check because she wasn\'t one of those high maintenance types, those princesses who needed constant reassurance and babying. She was supposed to be cool, into all the things that modern women were supposed to enjoy - manly tv shows and pursuits, superheroes, sports, politics, etc, etc. She was supposed to be down to earth, easy to talk to, never letting her emotions get the better of her; she was supposed to always be witty, always able to see the funny side of things, in a perpetual state of relaxation. She was supposed to always pay her own way and above all, she was supposed to be aggressively sexual… More than anything, she wanted to show her real self to men from the get-go - the fact that she was very emotional (she saw it as an asset - she could feel compassion for others). She was also very needy - she had endured a very difficult childhood and as a result in relationships she needed constant reassurance in order to feel safe. Deep down she felt that she deserved someone who understood that and would just provide it for her no questions asked, rather than the usual type she dated who was so begrudging about it, like she was asking for something that was too expensive. She could be whiny at times when she didn\'t get her own way, and terribly unsophisticated - getting around in sweat pants with no makeup on, leaving the toilet door open, not doing the dishes, etc, but she was only human, and contrary to common custom she actually didn\'t enjoy cleaning - she had much better things to do with her time. She enjoyed chick flicks and ridiculously over the top soap operas and romance novels - and didn\'t want to have to apologise for it. She also liked girly pop music and thought most male team sports were barbaric and violent.  She was completely impractical. She was a dreamer and always had to do things the hard way. She was also impulsive, selfish, and childish.  But men didn\'t seem to like these things about her. As soon as she started to show them these things, to show them her real self, they would bail. She\'d experienced it countless times. The truth was that they wanted the woman who could go to work and make the big bucks, but also be the helpless, frail yet hot little feminine kitten that spent forty hours a week at the gym, the impeccably dressed and manicured vegan that cleaned the house obsessively because she couldn\'t handle anything being out of place. They wanted someone who was into the same violent TV shows and sports they were into. They wanted a woman who would show them that she wanted sex as much as they did, but when in bed, would be a total pushover, giving them the foreplay they wanted without needing to receive any for herself from them. They wanted a woman - but one who wasn\'t emotional, one who was practical, one who was solution-focused. Someone who didn\'t feel every little feeling, someone who bottled everything up like they did and relied on pure logic to make decisions.  They basically wanted a woman who was a man. A creature who adored and needed men and relationships, but who let men do their own thing; a woman who wouldn\'t sink her hooks into them, a woman who didn\'t need to know how they felt about her or where she stood. A woman who was too independent and \'busy living her own life\'.  But she simply wasn\'t like that. She always wanted to know where she stood with men. She wanted commitment. She wasn\'t footloose and fancy free - she wanted to know that things were definitely going somewhere - otherwise, what was the bloody point? For men to expect her not to want those things… Well, it seemed terribly unfair. They were essentially telling her not to be herself. The worst part about it was that other women were telling her not to be herself as well, as were all the self-help books that lined her shelves. \"Don\'t be yourself,\" they warned, \"you\'ll scare him away. Pretend to be cool. Pretend to be aloof and unemotional. Pretend to be busy. That\'ll win him over, fool him into thinking you\'re actually a man with a vagina and a set of breasts.\" And so she pretended. And always, inevitably, the facade unravelled, bit by bit, exposing more and more of her real and undesirable personality, like a favourite old t-shirt showing through the bare skin underneath, becoming more and more threadbare with every turn in the washing machine.  The last relationship had been the worst. She had actually grown very adept at fooling men at that point - however, she absolutely hated herself for it - she felt like a complete fake, pretending that she wasn\'t lonely and depressed, pretending that she was busy and fulfilled in her life. Pretending that she wasn\'t all needy and broken inside. It was horrible. And yet it worked superbly. At first. For the first time in her life a man had given her roses. He\'d written her a poem, taken her out to dinner, to a movie, to other places, too - he\'d cooked her dinner, introduced her to his mother and his friends, promised her the moon. And she had been so unbelievably happy.  But then the false persona had begun to unravel. She could see in his eyes, after some time; could see that he simply wasn\'t as impressed with her as he originally had been. It probably wasn\'t a conscious decision on his part… And she supposed, if he was a meaner type of person, he might feel duped rather than simply disappointed. He might become vicious and vindictive, thinking her playing some kind of game with him, pretending to be someone and then turning into someone else. But instead they simply grew apart over time. He withdrew back into his own world, and the more he withdrew, the worse she felt. She kept trying desperately to hold onto that original feeling, that exultation at adoring someone and being adored in return so completely, at being so wonderfully happy…  But she couldn\'t. He wasn\'t there anymore. He was there physically, but he wasn\'t really present. He was just going through the motions.  She had told him in the beginning that the worst feeling in the world was being with someone that you knew didn\'t love you anymore. The way they acted - the way they never looked at you anymore, never really saw you. The way they never seemed to listen to you anymore, like everything you said was already tired and stale before it even came out of your mouth. And she had told him - no, made him promise, even - leave me, she had said. Leave me before that happens. Promise.   He had made the promise but he hadn\'t left. He\'d stayed, like most men in that situation do, perhaps quietly hoping that his former love would once again emerge to replace the pale copy that now inhabited her body. She had been angry that he had done that. She had told him that she wouldn\'t have the strength to leave should the situation arise, that it would have to be him to be the one to end it, and he had promised. Yet here he was, a living ghost, expecting her to continue on with the relationship as though nothing was wrong. He expected her to do all the work - to kiss him and hug him and love him and talk to him knowing full well that HE WASN\'T THERE. She was dealing with nothing more than a mannequin, a hologram. And still he expected her to continue on.  She had done it, finally, she had found the strength to leave. And she had made damn sure it was dramatic and painful so that he would feel it, remember it. Because damn him for doing that to her. Damn him for hurting her so badly.   That had been four years ago. She had dated since then, but it was always with a certain amount of trepidation.', 1404),
(NULL,NULL,2,'Meet Cute','2016-03-29 20:56:50','2016-03-29 20:56:50','She stomped her feet and wrapped her coat around her even tighter as she braved the cold morning winds while she waited for the 8.15 train. Her gaze was drawn to the roads that ran parallel to the railway, towards the self-driving cars that neatly adorned them. As always, the traffic danced gracefully along in perfect harmony, the movements of the cars meticulously choreographed by a satellite network that orbited far above and cast its omniscient eye over everything. She would dearly love to be one of the lucky ones, one of those who either could afford or, for some special reason were afforded a permit that allowed them access to the cars for their work commutes. Everyone was allowed to use their self-driving cars during leisure times but during the work day the government hadn\'t wanted people to abandon the public transport system they had spent decades perfecting, so most people had to continue to suffer a long and ever increasingly crowded commute to work. If they really wanted to they of course had the option to buy the workday permit, but the cost of such a permit was so defiantly prohibitive that only the very wealthy ever bought them. The trains were for this reason incredibly crowded. Sometimes there were too many people waiting for a train at once and she found herself waiting for the next one because she couldn\'t, or rather, wouldn\'t bother trying to fit in her own. She preferred the 8.23, in fact, to the 8.15 train, but her experience with the 8.23 had been that too many other people shared the preference and so she took the earlier train to save herself the hassle of vying for a position on the later train. On this particularly cold and blustering morning the 8.15 just happened to be running late, which meant that the people waiting for the 8.23 had started to arrive. By 8.20 she surmised that by the time her 8.15 train did actually arrive the 8.23 train people would want to board it and thus they would probably push out most of the 8.15 people. The 8.15 people began to edge their way closer and closer towards the yellow lines while the 8.23 people just behind them began to clamber in as well, not wanting to forfeit their right to board the train any more than the 8.15 people. By 8.25, the 8.31 people had started to arrive also. The platform swelled with them all, the 8.15, 8.23 and 8.31 people, a swarm of angry commuters buzzing like bothered hornets. She sighed. People had already begun to turn. They were elbowing her and stepping on her feet. In situations like this she found it best just to bow out, to surrender to the competition and accept her fate: she was going to be late. It wasn\’t her fault - the trains were running late, not her. People at work would just have to understand. This was probably one of the reasons why she wasn\'t more successful at work. In any case, she made her way back through the swarm to the platform gates. She scanned her card and tried to go through the gate at the same time as another commuter who was also trying to exit. They ended up almost sandwiched together between the gates. As they both pulled back from the gate, she looked up to see her fellow escapee; a tall man with dark rimmed glasses, kind green eyes and short brown hair. He had a calm, nice kind of face. She had no idea who had scanned their card first. \"Sorry,\" she mumbled at the exact same time as he mumbled, \"Sorry! Didn\’t see you there.\" She smiled at him. \"I was in such a hurry to get away from the angry mob.\" \"Me too,\" he replied. \"Not worth potentially losing an eye for a seat on the train, is it? I\'d rather just be late.\" \"Exactly.\" He gestured for her to go through the gates before him. \"Thanks.\" One by one they scanned again and went through the gate. Once on the other side she contemplated the nearby cafe. She probably had time for a coffee while she waited for this situation to sort itself out. He followed her gaze. \"Thinking of waiting it out in there?\" \"Yes,\" she answered. \"Their coffee is pretty decent.\" He smiled at her shyly. \"Would you mind if I joined you?\" She laughed nervously. \"Not at all. I\'d appreciate the company.\" She thought he was very cute. Kind of shy and self-conscious, unlike the men she had met recently who were all false bravado and arrogance  (though one could be forgiven for wondering where their confidence came from). This man, however, should have all their confidence and more, but somehow miraculously didn\'t. They ordered and sat at the window, keeping an eye on the crowded platform. For a moment the gravity of the situation hit them - they were two strangers, opposite genders, at a public place not having properly met yet. It almost felt like a date except for the fact that it was 8.34 in the morning. Finally he broke the silence. \"By the way, my name is Peter.\" \"I\'m Ella,\" she replied. They clumsily shook hands over the table. \"It\'s nice to meet you, Ella.\" His eyes crinkled when he smiled - such a nice, friendly face. No visible signs of deception in it, just genuine joy at being there with her. \"Likewise.\"\r\n\"So, what do you do for a crust?\" \"I\'m a project manager at an IT company. And you?\" He replied, \"Wonderful,\" and seemed genuinely impressed. For once she didn\'t feel patronised after answering that question. \"I\'m an editor for a wildly unpopular literary journal.\" She laughed. \"What\'s it called? Maybe I\'ve heard of it.\" She thought about how good it would be if she did in fact know the publication, even though the chances were that she probably in all likelihood didn\'t. \"It\'s called Defiant Whimsy.\" He smiled crookedly as he watched her reaction to the name. \"It\'s a rather odd title, I know.\" \"You were right, I haven\'t heard of it,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"Although it sounds delightful. I\'ll buy a copy tonight.\" He laughed. \"Good luck finding one!\" \"Oh, will I have trouble finding it?\" He thought about it for a moment. \"Perhaps I should just send you a copy, it might be easier.\" She blushed. \"Oh, only if it\'s not too much trouble, of course!\" He looked so pleased that she wanted to read it; he was positively beaming. \"Not at all Ella! I hope you don\'t mind giving me your address, though - I am a stranger, after all!\" Then it was her turn to think about it for a moment. He seemed so nice, so genuine. She really didn\'t have a problem giving him her address (though she should have had a problem with it. Why were women so naive and trusting?). However, he said, \"I know, give me your work address, and I\'ll have it sent there! That way it\'s not at all creepy.\" She laughed. \"Okay.\" He took her details down, including her number. \"Splendid. You shall have a copy in no time. Then you can see for yourself why the publication is as unpopular as it is.\" \"I\"m sure it\'s not,\" she replied, laughing some more, marvelling at just how humble he was. It truly was refreshing. \r\n\"Tell me, have you managed a project that I might know about?\"\r\nShe nodded. \"The software that runs the Magnuson billboards, in fact.\" She pointed through the window at the gap between the gate to the train platform. \"They use them on all the train platforms and in some shopping centres.\"\r\n\"Wow,\" he said. \"Was that a complicated project?\" She contemplated his question for a moment. It had been rather complicated project, in fact. Electronics had come a long way in the last few decades - all electronics those days was considered \'smart eletronics\'. This meant that the billboards could calculate exactly who was watching them and thus were programmed to choose advertisements that would maximise their advertising potential. For example, if three women in their twenties, one woman in her fifties and two men in their forties were within eyeshot of the billboard (and specifically paying at least some attention to it) the billboard would choose ads that targeted the younger women as that would be considered more cost-efficient than choosing ads that would target all of the demographics together. Her team had written the programs that analysed the billboard\'s audience and then calculated which ads to play, as well as recording the information, sending it back to Magnuson and automatically billing the companies whose services were advertised based on how long their ads were visible and how many people saw them. Conversion rates further on down the line were also calculated - however her team hadn\'t been involved with that work - the marketing company they had worked for, Magnuson, had hired its own programmers in-house to do that, as the specifics of the algorithms that calculated conversion rates relied on data that was considered too top-secret to reveal to anyone, let alone her team. If competing marketing companies got hold of the data it could be disastrous to Magnuson and apparently there was quite a high price on the information, too. Magnuson had probably done the right thing keeping it under lock and key, in her opinion. If she had been offered twenty million for backdoor access to the data she didn\'t know if she could have maintained her integrity. \"About as complicated as any other,\" she told him. Magnuson had forced her and her team to sign strict non-disclosure agreements which meant that she could tell people she had programmed the billboards but not the exact nature of how they worked. They finished their coffees by 8.56 and noted to each other that the trains were still running late and the platform was still overcrowded. He pulled out his phone and played with it for a moment, looking something up, deep in thought. She took the time to examine his left hand - no ring finger. She wondered if he was single. Probably not - he was quite the catch. It was just her luck really to meet someone so perfect and have him not be available. He looked up from his phone a moment later. \"If you don\'t mind walking a kilometre or so, there\'s a bus we can catch…\" He watched her hopefully. \"A bus?\" She was uncertain. It had been a long time since she had taken a bus. \r\n\"Come on, it\'ll be quaint,\" he says. \"It\'ll take us where we need to go - it\'ll take a bit longer, of course, but really if you think about it we could be waiting a while anyway. At least this way we get to take our respective fates into our own hands.\" She couldn\'t help but like him then and she suspected that she agreed to walk a kilometre in uncomfortable shoes in order to take an outdated mode of transport into work simply in order to get the chance to spend more time with him. After they had dropped their fares into the bus driver\'s hand she went to take a seat at the front of the almost empty bus. "Oh, no,\" he chided her, \"if you\'re committed to taking a bus then you must commit to sitting at the very back. Only then can you fully appreciate the experience.\" And after a few minutes she knew exactly what he had meant by that. As they traversed the steep hills of the bus route the suspension at the back of the bus gently bounced them up and down, causing happy little bubbles of joy to pop in their bellies. They looked at each other each time they bounced and laughed in embarrassment at how much they, grown adults, were enjoying it. They chatted about hobbies and interests - he was a budding novelist, she an avid reader. She liked painting and drawing, he appreciated the arts. They had both taken a vow to stop watching TV although she hadn\'t admitted to him that she often cheated. They both liked fine wine and dining (who didn\'t, though). They both despised the beach, preferring instead to spend time in forests and at lakes for holidays. When finally they got into the city she was reluctant to leave him; she reminded herself that he had her details and was going to send her a copy of his publication. \"I had fun,\" he told her. \"We\'re so very late,\" she said, checking her watch. \"But I had fun too. Thanks for convincing me to take the bus.\" \"Any time,\" he answered. \"Well, I have to go now. I\'ll send you a copy of The Defiant Whimsy. Hey, I\'ll even sign it!\" She laughed at his silly joke. \"Alright Peter. Take care.\" \"You too, Ella. Bye.\" And just like that, it was over. She was so pleased, though, so taken with him, that she almost floated into work. Her thoughts were filled with him - how he smiled, the sound of his voice, how his aftershave smelled. When asked why she was so late she smiled as she told of the late trains. People looked at her quizzically; usually late trains made her angry - none the less, they let her strange behaviour go. Later she chastised herself for not asking if he was single. It was a question that burned away at her all day. Half the time she told herself, of course he was; he\'d been flirting with her, after all. Then the other half she told herself not to be so desperate and foolish. All the good men were already taken, and happily so.', 2306);(NULL,NULL,2,'Ella goes on a Bad Date.','Dating','2016-04-03 03:16:41','2016-04-03 03:16:41','She stood in front of the bathroom mirror playing with her hair, trying to decide if she should wear it up or down. To wear it down was always preferable; a woman of her age had to go to extra pains to look feminine, and long, flowing locks achieved that end quite well. However, a modern woman sometimes naturally preferred to wear her hair up, especially on hot or windy days or, as was the case today, when she had been waylaid at the office for an extra couple of hours and hadn’t had enough time when she had come home to wash and blow dry her hair.\r\n\r\nUp. She would wear it up. To hell with femininity - she didn’t have time for it today. \r\n\r\nShe was quite certain, anyway, that this date would be just as disappointing as every other date she had been on this year. The dating app she used showed her profiles of men that were guaranteed to be at least 67% compatible with her. 67% compatibility had been proven by extensive market research to be the bare minimum percentage of compatibility that people needed in order to forge ahead with a relationship, and market research never lied. \r\n\r\nShe slipped on her shoes. He had chosen the restaurant, the date and time. It was a Wednesday evening, the restaurant a little Italian place in the valley. Not too expensive, not too cheap. Not Friday night… \r\n\r\nShe sighed. Friday and Saturday nights were the worst. Sitting at home alone with her cat, watching some cookie cutter police procedural or some ridiculously contrived romantic comedy specially manufactured to sate her lonelines in between ads for hair dye and anti wrinkle cream. Look, those movies said, even Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz have trouble with men - and they\'re beautiful! So don\'t feel bad! \r\n\r\nPfft, Ella would think to herself, as if they really had trouble with men - they wouldn\'t have; not, at least, until they had finally hit the point at which botox and plastic surgery was ineffective, anyway. Only then could those women truly know what it was like for the average woman. Where were the romantic comedies starring women who actually looked their age, anyway? They simply didn\'t exist. \r\n\r\nShe poured extra kibble into the cats feed bowl and left for the evening. They had decided to meet at the restaurant. It added that extra element of excitement for her - would he turn up at all? Would he turn up early and stake out a position at the bar so he could see her when she walked in? Would he quietly make an exit if she wasnt pretty enough? \r\n\r\nShe tried to push those thoughts aside as she entered her self-driving car and typed the location into the console. She was being neurotic… Most men, she knew, would stick the date out anyway, in the hopes of having sex later on. Men would have sex with anyone who was willing, including women they weren\'t particularly attracted to, and women they actually actively despised. It was for precisely that reason that it was just about impossible these days for her to tell if a man actually liked her... Unless she gave in and slept with him. She simply couldn\'t trust men to end things if they didn\'t happen to like her; it was almost as if suffering through a personality they didn\'t enjoy was worth it in the end for them, and the sex was the ultimate act of revenge for all that suffering, and as soon as they obtained it they could finally show their real feelings towards a woman - whether love and affection, luke warm sentiments, cold indifference or actual palpable hatred. And if, at that point, the woman had happened to develop feelings for the seemingly nice, caring, supportive man she had spent all that time with, well - it took a long time for her to realise that that version of him was now gone forever. \r\n\r\nThe problem for her was that she didn\'t want to have to wait until she had sex with a man to find out if he actually secretly despised her, and it was such a pressing one that of late she had resorted to reading self helf books in the vain hope that they might magically offer up the answer to her. They lined her shelves like girl scout badges, having been read and collected and now left to gather dust. \r\n\r\nOne such book was titled \"Stop Being Such a Doormat for Crying Out Loud\". Its thesis was simply that women were giving men everything they wanted without getting what they needed in return. It advocated that women put off sex for several months and then right before they were about to do the deed bring out their list of demands which the man could then either accept or reject. Obviously if a man rejected these demands it not only meant that he wasn\'t going to get laid... The woman would have to be prepared to walk. And if the man did decide to agree to her demands? Well, it was anyone\'s guess as to whether he would stand by the promises he had made. After all, if a man was willing to sleep with a woman he didn\'t even like, or wasn\'t even attracted to, why would he keep a promise to one? \r\n\r\nAnother book took those sentiments and then extended them a step further. \"Make Him Pay\" advocated treating men as dismally as possible for as long as possible by ignoring their calls, letting them know they were drastically unimportant and just generally taking advantage of them in every conceivable way. It failed to address the core issue though - that men often slept with women they despised anyway, so treating a man terribly just ensured that he might hate you with even more vigor later on.\r\n\r\nThe very last book she had read, the one which had put her off dating self help books for life, was called \"Stop Being Such a Selfish Bitch Already.\" In it the author suggested she put aside her own selfish needs and wants and focus on her date\'s selfish needs and wants instead. The book told her to  sleep with a man as soon as he wanted to, and above all, not to pester him about calling or showing any consideration, or try in any way to have him meet any of her needs. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, the advice from the last book would work - if the man in question genuinely liked her. If he didn\'t, well - it was simply a recipe for disaster. Once he realised he hated her, after having sex with her, he would simply use her to fulfil his needs until someone better came along, someone he didn\'t actually despise. Or someone better looking.\r\n\r\nThe car pulled up to the restaurant. When she alighted it zoomed quietly off; it was programmed to find nearby parking and remain there until she summoned it again. \r\n\r\nThe restaurant seemed nice enough; the table linen and cutlery were clean, at least. She was seated by herself quite conspicuously in the middle of the dining area. If her date failed to show then escape for her would not be quiet and speedy - rather, it would be slow and humiliating. \r\n\r\nThe  couple seared next to her were young and in love. They leaned across their table and kissed, making obnoxious sucking noises. The boy looked at his girlfriend with a mixture of desire and incredulity. How lucky he must feel, she thought, to have captured such a lovely creature. And her, so lucky to have such attention showered upon her, and not even having had to earn it in any discernible way - she simply had to look the way she did. She could have the personality of Hitler and he would be too blinded by her youthful beauty to even notice. She could have him executing traitors and he\'d happily do it, until he slept with her and the veil was lifted, and he finally realised how truly awful she was. \r\n\r\nHer date arrived then, fifteen minutes late, flashing her the same kind of smile you might expect to see coming from the mouth of a used car salesman, only half genuine and tinged with a certain measure of desperation - hungry for a sale. She could see him eyeing her from head to toe - he was being rather obvious about it. His gaze lingered a little long on her midsection - a problem area she couldnt seem to fix no matter how hard she tried. It made her feel unworthy. \r\n\r\nHe apologised for his tardiness. \"This place is a little further away than I thought it would be.\" \r\nShe smiled politely at him, but alarm bells were going off in her head. She checked his ring finger. No ring. Why had he chosen that place, anyway, if it was so far away? Where exactly was it so out of the way from? Work? An ex wife? A current wife? Several casual acquaintances? \r\n\r\n\"Thats alright,\" she lied, her polite smike feeling kind of forced. \"I imagine it couldnt be helped?\" \r\nInstead of offering up a reasonable explanation he simply shrugged and shot her what she imagined that he thought was his most charming smile; unfortunately, charming smiles often failed to work their magic on Ella.\r\n\r\nBesdies, she believed that it wasn\'t that difficult to plan properly for a date, to leave early so as to be sure to arrive on time - and to call or text the person unfortunate enough to be left waiting for you if you knew you were going to be late. They lived in a society with self driving cars, after all, and the cars themselves ran like clockwork, even if society itself didn\'t (there was only ever roughly one mechanical error every ninety-two days). So there really was no excuse for lateness anymore apart from a lack of foresight, or pure laziness, two qualities she despised equally. \r\n\r\nShe watched as he took his seat and got comfortable. Now the awkward part of the date would begin - they would attempt to reconcile the person sitting in front of them with the avatar they had texted with online for the last week or so. She tried to remember the details he had told her about himself - details that had ignited a few tentative sparks of hope in her heart. He was into skiing - good. Sporty. He played the drums. Great - creative. He had a six year old girl from a previous marriage - could be good or bad. \r\n\r\nThey ordered wines - these situations tended to go better with some social lubrication. \"So, Ellen, how was your day?\"\r\nShe sighed, inwardly scowling, outwardly tryng hard not to let her irriation show through. Her name was Ella, not Ellen. She supposed it wasn\'t too much of a mistake - he was kind of close, anyway.  \r\n\"Its Ella,\" she corrected him, and she watched his face for a reaction. He barely reacted at all, though - a real smooth customer, hardly missing a beat. \r\n\"Im sorry, Ella. Its been a real motherfucker of a day.\" \r\n Ella flinched. She hadn\'t been expecting swearing. \"Why has your day been so bad?\" \r\n\"Oh, you know, just work and stuff. Dont worry babe - Im not gonna let it ruin our night.\" \r\nShe gritted her teeth. Babe? \r\n\"Should we order?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. She could already see that they weren\'t going to get very far into the meal before she got up and left him there. She just knew that he wasn\'t the guy she wanted - she had been on more than enough dates to be able to determine that kind of thing very early on at this point - and she wasn\'t going to waste a whole meal, or even half of one. She would give him another chance, get to know him a little bit more, and give her car time to find its way back to the restaurant, but she was ninety-nine percent certain that she nothing he said would make any difference.\r\n \r\n\"Let\'s chat for a bit, yeah? What do you think?\"\r\n\"Okay,\" he replied. \"So Ella… How long have you been single?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a question men always asked, along with do you live alone and how many cats do you own.\r\n\"Several months. Yourself?\" It was a complete lie, of course. In actual fact it had been three years. When she told men that they would ask why it had been so long. And the answer to that question was rather complicated and not the kind of subject best discussed on a good first date. She found that lying and making it too short an amount of time worried them as well - it might suggest to them that she wasn\'t \"over\" the last guy yet. \r\n\r\n\"A few weeks.\" \r\n\r\nThe men that the dating app matched her with didn\'t seem to need a period of mourning over their last relationship - they tended to move on rather quickly. It was a fact that often disturbed her. Whenever she ended a relationship, even one that had only lasted a few months (which, at this point, was usually the amount of time they did end up lasting) she still needed time to adjust to being single again, to being lonely, to being rejected. The men she dated, on the other hand, didn\'t seem to bat an eyelid - they wanted to get back on that horse as quickly as possible. It astounded her. \r\n\r\n\"That\'s not very long, John,\" she said. \r\nHe shrugged. \"It was just a fling.\"\r\n\r\nThat was another thing - these men that she was matched with - every one of them - seemed to be the \'flinging\' type rather than the \'sticking\' type. To her, being in a three month fling was something to be embarrassed about, something to be ashamed of - and she was usually the last to know that that was what she was in fact in. That sinking feeling she would get in the pit of her stomach when she realised the guy she was dating hadn\'t been looking at the bigger picture like she had… He hadn\'t been thinking of the future like she had… She had been picturing picket fences, joint mortgages and children, while he had been picturing doggy style, head jobs and sex outdoors. And just when she had started to feel comfortable, to feel that yes, this time, it actually might happen for her, this time a guy might actually stick around long enough to provide her with these things… That was about the time when they started to pull back, to fade away into the night like a timid ghost.  \r\n\r\nShe would call, and text; they would ignore. She would worry and wonder; they would go on with their lives. Finally, after a month or so of being ignored, they might call again, ask to \'catch up\', ask if she wanted to \'come over\' and \'hang out\' at 10pm at night, and only then, when she turned up on their doorstep, tears streaming down her face, a crazy, wild look in her eyes, questions pouring out of her mouth, only then would they finally come clean to her - what do you mean, Ella, you were thinking of us living together? Of us getting married, one day having children? You were thinking that far ahead? Seriously Ella, I was still trying to figure out whether I liked you or not… As for you being the mother of my children, well, geez, that\'s a bit much… \r\n\r\nWHAT??!!!?!! Ella would think to herself. After all that wooing, after all that chasing, after all that acting needy and posessive in the beginning… After all of that, now you tell me you didn\'t even want me? Didn\'t even see a future with me? What the hell???\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath, a sip of her wine and forced herself to relax. \"I see,\" she replied. \r\n\r\nHe laughed, flashed her a charming smile. At least he was perceptive enough to know she wasn\'t impressed. \"Hey, she knew it was a fling. We both went into it with our eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nThe men she had dated had given her warning signs along the way - hell, some of them had even told her they weren\'t \'ready\' for a \'long term thing\'; the problem was that wonderful beginning stage, that stage of utter euphoria, like the stage those kids at the table next to them were in - the stage where he looked at her with stars in his eyes, adored her, cherished her, kissed the ground she walked on. Forgetting those wonderful beginnings was damn hard - even when the current reality of the relationship was repeatedly smacking her square in the face. It was near impossible to believe that someone so caring, so thoughtful and wonderful could turn so cold in a matter of weeks. \r\n\r\nWhen they would start to tell her that they were hanging out with their friends that Friday night, also that Saturday; when suddenly they didn\'t want to be with her all the time anymore, she knew it was the beginning of the end. Suddenly her text messages would go unanswered. Suddenly there were no date nights anymore - only streaming video and cuddling on the couch. Suddenly all those things she had wanted them to do as a couple - going to markets, walks in the park, etc - suddenly they were things they would do \'next weekend\'. Next weekend never came. Suddenly even waiting until she had come was too much effort for him. Suddenly the things she had come to expect were now her acting \'needy\' and \'over entitled\' - where before they had just been givens. She in fact HAD been entitled to them in his eyes up until then. \r\n\r\nShe gulped down the rest of her wine, blinked a few times. Back to reality. She stared at the man in front of her. How might he hurt her? Was he the blissfully ignorant type? An emotional blackmailer? Selfish and self-absorbed beyond repair? Or was he wilfully indignant and aggressive? Vindictive and poisonous? Who could tell? \r\n\r\nAll she knew was that his true nature would take a few months to finally rise to the surface and make itself known. She found this thought hilariously funny and laughed out loud for several seconds. Perhaps the wine had gone to her head.\r\n\r\n\"Ella? What are you laughing at?\" \r\n\"Nothing, John. Nothing. Hey, you know what, I just realised, I forgot to feed my cat! Can you believe that?\"\r\nThe charming smile faded from his face. \"You\'re kidding, right?\"\r\n\"No. I\'m so sorry.\" His smile was replaced with a cold, hard stare. \"You\'re fucking kidding me!\" \r\n\r\nVindictive. Phew! She had dodged a bullet. \"I have to go home now.\" She rose from the table and collected her bag. \"It was nice meeting you.

The senior of the two was a woman in her forties named Sue. She was impeccably dressed, as always, a real power player. The attractive, suave man in his twenties seated next to her was Sam. Ella had spoken to the both of them on a regular basis while working on the bilboards project.\r\n\r\nShe felt a sudden jolt of fear course through her body as she wondered whether they were there that day because they somehow knew about her conversation with Peter. Perhaps they knew that she had told him that her team had worked on the billboards. Perhaps they were there to suggest to her boss Bill that she be fired for breaking the non disclosure agreement. However, her thoughts were put to rest when she spotted them looking at her through the glass windows, waving and smiling at her in an exceedingly friendly manner. They didn\'t seem as though they were there to admonish her for breaking the agreement.\r\n\r\nBill intercepted her in the hallway on her way to the coffee room.\r\n\"Where have you been, Ella? The Magnusson people are here. They called an impromptu meeting - they\'re thinking about offering us another project! They want to discuss the details with the higher-ups - you, me, Craig and John.\"\r\n\"I\'m so sorry I\'m late, Bill,\" she gushed. \"The trains were running late so I decided to catch the bus - and that turned out to be a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt incredibly guilty for telling Bill this half-truth. Part of her guilt was caused by the fact that she still felt as though she was floating along the ground effortlessly after having met Peter that day, such a sense of lightness and ease in her footsteps that day. It had been worth it being late for work just to have met him, even if the Magnusson reps and her bosses ended up being mad at her. \r\n\r\nBut Bill wasn\'t mad - he simply smiled reassuringly at her. \"It\'s alright, Ella. I know you wouldn\'t have been late if you could possibly help it. Just go grab yourself a coffee and then come and join us in meeting room 2 when you\'re ready and we\'ll start.\"\r\n\r\nSue smiled broadly at her as she entered meeting room 2. Her young sidekick smiled at her too. His smile was the perfect mix of friendliness and professional respect. She imagined he had practiced that smile in front of the mirror for hours to get it just right. \r\n\r\nAs Ella took a seat in between Bill and Craig, the quality assurance manager, everyone in the room exchanged pleasantries. When they were all done, Sue filled everyone in on her reasons for calling the meeting. \r\n\r\n\"We were so impressed with the work your team did on the bilboards project that we were thinking of giving you something else, something a little more involved this time.\" She paused to guage their responses. John, the senior manager of the  company, looked at Bill with the pleasantly surprised expression of a person who has just found a hundred dollar note in front of him on the footpath. To work with the Magnusson Corporation once was quite fortunate, but to have the opportunity to work with them again was a God-send. Their projects were challenging, large-scale and extremely well-paying. \r\n\r\nJohn attempted to remain poker faced but failed. As he turned back to look at Sue, a cheshire cat-like grin was threatening to overtake his face. He struggled to sound casual. \"I think we could probably accomodate you again.\"\r\n\"So this is something your in-house development team can\'t handle themselves then, I take it?\" Bill inquired. \r\nIt was Sue\'s young associate Sam who replied, \"We usually would get them to handle a project of this magnitude, but lately we\'ve been having some issues -\"\r\n\"We were so impressed with the way your team handled the billboard project that we thought we\'d give you a crack at this one,\" Sue quickly cut her associate off. She shot him a disapproving look. \"We\'d like to give you some specs and get a detailed proposal from you as soon as possible. What do you all think?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Ella then, smiling in a knowing sort of way. Ella smiled unsurely back at her. She wondered if Sue was just happy to have another woman present. The two of them weren\'t particularly close and she wasn\'t the decision maker in the room - John and Bill were. But the woman was watching her specifically, waiting for her to say something, so she did. \r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\"\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Sue said, not waiting to hear from anyone else. \"We look forward to seeing your proposal soon.\"\r\n\"Before we go,\" Sam added, \"I just wanted to let you know that this time you guys will have access to some pretty sensitive data. We\'ll actually need you to sign some contracts from our lawyers before you even take a look at the preliminary specs. Is that okay?\"\r\n\r\nBill stared questioningly at Sam for a minute. Ella imagined that he, just like her, was wondering whether the Magnusson Corporation was finally going to share some of their precious insider secrets with them. She felt a little anxious but excited at the same time. Finally Bill replied, \"Sure. No problem. Send them over.\"', 2306),

His lips curled into a hesitant, conspiratorial sort of smile as he looked up to meet her gaze again. \"John is thinking of retiring soon - in the next couple of years, actually. I\'m betting this new Magnusson thing will take around that long to finish. Anyways, if we do really well with it, I\'ll end up being the new general manager, and that will leave my job open for someone else...\" Ella realised then that he must have had the same talk with Craig earlier and now it was simply her turn. Craig had, after all, been with the company for eight years - Ella had only been there for six. Craig had originally held the project manager position she now held but had opted to take over the QA manager position when the previous one had been suddenly and unexpectedly deported. Ella had been hired as Craig\'s replacement. She blinked as she noticed Bill\'s attention on her - he had, in fact, been watching her for the last half a minute or so to gauge her reaction to his words. She found herself laughing nervously under his scrutiny. \"I guess Craig and I are in competition then?\" Bill shook his head, his eyes indicating a hint of surprised confusion. \"No way, Ella. While it\'s certainly true that Craig has been here longer and therefore has a little seniority over you, honestly... You are worth three of him.\" Ella felt a sudden wave of some overpowering emotion take hold of her and wash over her from head to toe. She suddenly felt faint. Soon her head was swimming from the unexpected praise and she even began to blush for the first time in years. But just as quickly she began to feel something else... It was difficult to pinpoint... Guilt? Shame? She wasn\'t sure exactly what it was, and she had no idea what the source of it was, but it began to pool annoyingly at the corners of her eyes, uncomfortably welling in tears which threatened to betray her at any moment and embarrass her further. Bill smiled kindly at her. \"Today is the first time I can ever recall you being late to work. But that\'s really the least of it. You\'re so dedicated... You\'ve really given your absolute all for this role, for this company. But more than anything else...\" He regarded her as he smiled and leaned back in his swivel chair, crossing his thick arms over his chest. \"I can just see you still being here in five - hell, maybe even ten year\'s time.\" His words were like a hearty and well-meant yet completely overdone slap on the back, meant to be reassuring and kind, but more jarring and painful. She knew that the effect of them was meant to be pride; however, she felt even sadder than she had just a moment ago, and that un-nameable feeling that had overtaken her pride continued to amplify. She nodded at him, forcing a smile, keeping her eyes wide open like a character in an anime film in order to keep the tears from spilling out. \"Thank you so much, Bill. I really appreciate that.\" He nodded, apparently not noticing her strange facial expression nor the tears. \"I should let you get back to it I guess. If you could just sign the contracts before you go, I\'ll have some papers ready for you to take home tonight - oh, you don\'t mind working some overtime, do you? I really want to have a plan ready for Sue ASAP. Is that okay?\" \"Sure!\" Her answer was over-bright but he didn\'t notice. His head was busy with visions of the future where he was the new general manager. She signed the contracts and left, heading for the bathroom to fix her eyes and makeup. Back at her desk she busied herself with work for the rest of the day, piling it over her feelings and effectively burying them. By the end of the day they were almost forgotten.',703),

I know you wouldn\'t have been late if you could possibly help it. Just go grab yourself a coffee and then come and join us in meeting room 2 when you\'re ready and we\'ll start.\"\r\n\r\nSue smiled broadly at her as she entered meeting room 2. Her young sidekick smiled at her too. His smile was the perfect mix of friendliness and professional respect. She imagined he had practiced that smile in front of the mirror for hours to get it just right. \r\n\r\nAs Ella took a seat in between Bill and Craig, the quality assurance manager, everyone in the room exchanged pleasantries. When they were all done, Sue filled everyone in on her reasons for calling the meeting. \r\n\r\n\"We were so impressed with the work your team did on the bilboards project that we were thinking of giving you something else, something a little more involved this time.\" She paused to guage their responses. John, the senior manager of the  company, looked at Bill with the pleasantly surprised expression of a person who has just found a hundred dollar note in front of him on the footpath. To work with the Magnusson Corporation once was quite fortunate, but to have the opportunity to work with them again was a God-send. Their projects were challenging, large-scale and extremely well-paying. \r\n\r\nJohn attempted to remain poker faced but failed. As he turned back to look at Sue, a cheshire cat-like grin was threatening to overtake his face. He struggled to sound casual. \"I think we could probably accomodate you again.\"\r\n\"So this is something your in-house development team can\'t handle themselves then, I take it?\" Bill inquired. \r\nIt was Sue\'s young associate Sam who replied, \"We usually would get them to handle a project of this magnitude, but lately we\'ve been having some issues -\"\r\n\"We were so impressed with the way your team handled the billboard project that we thought we\'d give you a crack at this one,\" Sue quickly cut her associate off. She shot him a disapproving look. \"We\'d like to give you some specs and get a detailed proposal from you as soon as possible. What do you all think?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Ella then, smiling in a knowing sort of way. Ella smiled unsurely back at her. She wondered if Sue was just happy to have another woman present. The two of them weren\'t particularly close and she wasn\'t the decision maker in the room - John and Bill were. But the woman was watching her specifically, waiting for her to say something, so she did. \r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\"\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Sue said, not waiting to hear from anyone else. \"We look forward to seeing your proposal soon.\"\r\n\"Before we go,\" Sam added, \"I just wanted to let you know that this time you guys will have access to some pretty sensitive data. We\'ll actually need you to sign some contracts from our lawyers before you even take a look at the preliminary specs. Is that okay?\"\r\n\r\nBill stared questioningly at Sam for a minute. Ella imagined that he, just like her, was wondering whether the Magnusson Corporation was finally going to share some of their precious insider secrets with them. She felt a little anxious but excited at the same time. Finally Bill replied, \"Sure. No problem. Send them over.\"', 899);
