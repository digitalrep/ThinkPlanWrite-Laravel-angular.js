His lips curled into a hesitant, conspiratorial sort of smile as he looked up to meet her gaze again. \"John is thinking of retiring soon - in the next couple of years, actually. I\'m betting this new Magnusson thing will take around that long to finish. Anyways, if we do really well with it, I\'ll end up being the new general manager, and that will leave my job open for someone else...\" Ella realised then that he must have had the same talk with Craig earlier and now it was simply her turn. Craig had, after all, been with the company for eight years - Ella had only been there for six. Craig had originally held the project manager position she now held but had opted to take over the QA manager position when the previous one had been suddenly and unexpectedly deported. Ella had been hired as Craig\'s replacement. She blinked as she noticed Bill\'s attention on her - he had, in fact, been watching her for the last half a minute or so to gauge her reaction to his words. She found herself laughing nervously under his scrutiny. \"I guess Craig and I are in competition then?\" Bill shook his head, his eyes indicating a hint of surprised confusion. \"No way, Ella. While it\'s certainly true that Craig has been here longer and therefore has a little seniority over you, honestly... You are worth three of him.\" Ella felt a sudden wave of some overpowering emotion take hold of her and wash over her from head to toe. She suddenly felt faint. Soon her head was swimming from the unexpected praise and she even began to blush for the first time in years. But just as quickly she began to feel something else... It was difficult to pinpoint... Guilt? Shame? She wasn\'t sure exactly what it was, and she had no idea what the source of it was, but it began to pool annoyingly at the corners of her eyes, uncomfortably welling in tears which threatened to betray her at any moment and embarrass her further. Bill smiled kindly at her. \"Today is the first time I can ever recall you being late to work. But that\'s really the least of it. You\'re so dedicated... You\'ve really given your absolute all for this role, for this company. But more than anything else...\" He regarded her as he smiled and leaned back in his swivel chair, crossing his thick arms over his chest. \"I can just see you still being here in five - hell, maybe even ten year\'s time.\" His words were like a hearty and well-meant yet completely overdone slap on the back, meant to be reassuring and kind, but more jarring and painful. She knew that the effect of them was meant to be pride; however, she felt even sadder than she had just a moment ago, and that un-nameable feeling that had overtaken her pride continued to amplify. She nodded at him, forcing a smile, keeping her eyes wide open like a character in an anime film in order to keep the tears from spilling out. \"Thank you so much, Bill. I really appreciate that.\" He nodded, apparently not noticing her strange facial expression nor the tears. \"I should let you get back to it I guess. If you could just sign the contracts before you go, I\'ll have some papers ready for you to take home tonight - oh, you don\'t mind working some overtime, do you? I really want to have a plan ready for Sue ASAP. Is that okay?\" \"Sure!\" Her answer was over-bright but he didn\'t notice. His head was busy with visions of the future where he was the new general manager. She signed the contracts and left, heading for the bathroom to fix her eyes and makeup. Back at her desk she busied herself with work for the rest of the day, piling it over her feelings and effectively burying them. By the end of the day they were almost forgotten.',703);
