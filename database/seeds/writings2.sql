(NULL,NULL,2,'An Impromptu Meeting','2016-05-02 03:20:44','2016-05-02 03:20:44','When she arrived at the office, she saw two reps from Magnusson through the large interior glass windows of meeting room 2. The senior of the two was a woman in her forties named Sue. She was impeccably dressed, as always, a real power player. The attractive, suave man in his twenties seated next to her was Sam. Ella had spoken to the both of them on a regular basis while working on the bilboards project.\r\n\r\nShe felt a sudden jolt of fear course through her body as she wondered whether they were there that day because they somehow knew about her conversation with Peter. Perhaps they knew that she had told him that her team had worked on the billboards. Perhaps they were there to suggest to her boss Bill that she be fired for breaking the non disclosure agreement. However, her thoughts were put to rest when she spotted them looking at her through the glass windows, waving and smiling at her in an exceedingly friendly manner. They didn\'t seem as though they were there to admonish her for breaking the agreement.\r\n\r\nBill intercepted her in the hallway on her way to the coffee room.\r\n\"Where have you been, Ella? The Magnusson people are here. They called an impromptu meeting - they\'re thinking about offering us another project! They want to discuss the details with the higher-ups - you, me, Craig and John.\"\r\n\"I\'m so sorry I\'m late, Bill,\" she gushed. \"The trains were running late so I decided to catch the bus - and that turned out to be a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt incredibly guilty for telling Bill this half-truth. Part of her guilt was caused by the fact that she still felt as though she was floating along the ground effortlessly after having met Peter that day, such a sense of lightness and ease in her footsteps that day. It had been worth it being late for work just to have met him, even if the Magnusson reps and her bosses ended up being mad at her. \r\n\r\nBut Bill wasn\'t mad - he simply smiled reassuringly at her. \"It\'s alright, Ella. I know you wouldn\'t have been late if you could possibly help it. Just go grab yourself a coffee and then come and join us in meeting room 2 when you\'re ready and we\'ll start.\"\r\n\r\nSue smiled broadly at her as she entered meeting room 2. Her young sidekick smiled at her too. His smile was the perfect mix of friendliness and professional respect. She imagined he had practiced that smile in front of the mirror for hours to get it just right. \r\n\r\nAs Ella took a seat in between Bill and Craig, the quality assurance manager, everyone in the room exchanged pleasantries. When they were all done, Sue filled everyone in on her reasons for calling the meeting. \r\n\r\n\"We were so impressed with the work your team did on the bilboards project that we were thinking of giving you something else, something a little more involved this time.\" She paused to guage their responses. John, the senior manager of the  company, looked at Bill with the pleasantly surprised expression of a person who has just found a hundred dollar note in front of him on the footpath. To work with the Magnusson Corporation once was quite fortunate, but to have the opportunity to work with them again was a God-send. Their projects were challenging, large-scale and extremely well-paying. \r\n\r\nJohn attempted to remain poker faced but failed. As he turned back to look at Sue, a cheshire cat-like grin was threatening to overtake his face. He struggled to sound casual. \"I think we could probably accomodate you again.\"\r\n\"So this is something your in-house development team can\'t handle themselves then, I take it?\" Bill inquired. \r\nIt was Sue\'s young associate Sam who replied, \"We usually would get them to handle a project of this magnitude, but lately we\'ve been having some issues -\"\r\n\"We were so impressed with the way your team handled the billboard project that we thought we\'d give you a crack at this one,\" Sue quickly cut her associate off. She shot him a disapproving look. \"We\'d like to give you some specs and get a detailed proposal from you as soon as possible. What do you all think?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Ella then, smiling in a knowing sort of way. Ella smiled unsurely back at her. She wondered if Sue was just happy to have another woman present. The two of them weren\'t particularly close and she wasn\'t the decision maker in the room - John and Bill were. But the woman was watching her specifically, waiting for her to say something, so she did. \r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\"\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Sue said, not waiting to hear from anyone else. \"We look forward to seeing your proposal soon.\"\r\n\"Before we go,\" Sam added, \"I just wanted to let you know that this time you guys will have access to some pretty sensitive data. We\'ll actually need you to sign some contracts from our lawyers before you even take a look at the preliminary specs. Is that okay?\"\r\n\r\nBill stared questioningly at Sam for a minute. Ella imagined that he, just like her, was wondering whether the Magnusson Corporation was finally going to share some of their precious insider secrets with them. She felt a little anxious but excited at the same time. Finally Bill replied, \"Sure. No problem. Send them over.\"', 899);
