###Laravel API Boilerplate (JWT Edition) & Angular.js & Bootstrap

* Auth using JSON web tokens (Refresh on certain pages, otherwise expire in 2 hours)
* Register, Verify Email, Reset Email, Login, Logout, Delete
* RESTful API for Angular
* User->Projects->Writings->Characters/Plot Outline, User->Logs

###Recent updates

####Nov 30

* Fallback to cookies for Safari incognito mode
* Refresh JSON web tokens

###April

* Changed theme (still not sure if I'm 100% happy with it)
* Added Plot Outline and Characters
* Changed text size for certain dpi
* Fixed minor UI issues
* Worked on Accessibility Support

###To Do

- Fix Verify Email (less than a day)
- Make sure that on each page it checks to see if User still has valid token and log out if not. Some pages lack this. (a day)
- Fix minor UI issues with Characters, Plot Outline (a day)
- Fix responsive (> 768) Calendar on Dash (not sure how long)
- Better theme (a few days possibly)
- Add tags (a day to a few days)
- Add support for community - sharing and critiquing (could take a long time)

###Possible To Do

- Angular 2?
