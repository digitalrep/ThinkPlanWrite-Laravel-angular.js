Her shoulders would slump and her eyes would grow suddenly very tired looking, and her mouth would droop. She was like a candle that burned more brightly the more it was beheld. When no one was looking it would fizzle out. \r\n\r\nSue was one of a common breed of women who absolutely loved to be catty - the cattier the better, in fact - however, heaven forbid anyone ever call her out on it; her ego protected her from it, casting a protective shawl over bitchiness so that it only came out in very subversive ways. In this way Sue never need even be aware of the fact that she was an absolute cow.\r\n\r\nElla imagined that she targeted women she felt threatened by - Ella herself couldn\'t understand this, though, as she quickly acknowledged any ill feelings she had towards other women and let them pass her by. She refused to be so petty. But Sue lived for pettiness. The moment she met Ella she felt threatened. By what, Ella could only guess - Ella wasn\'t bad looking; she wasn\'t a supermodel or anything. It could be that, however Ella thought Sue herself was quite good looking. It could have been Ella\'s talent and proficiency at her job - although the two were in different fields so she doubted it was that. Ella was thinner than Sue, it was probably that. \r\n\r\nSue liked to pretend she was talking about one thing when in actuality they were just thinly veiled insults. One could be mistaken, the first time they heard Sue talk, into thinking that Sue was actually talking about the subject matter she was discussing, but when one was exposed to Sue time and time again one began to realise that the woman was just using her favourite topics as delivery vehicles for her snide remarks.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Sue pretended she was talking about a swimming centre in her suburb. \"The only problem with it is this skirting they use around the edges of the change rooms. I hate it, it\'s too long.\" At first \r\n\r\nElla truly felt as though every movement the woman made, and the way in which she spoke every word, every facial expression she made, and every turn of phrase she used was somehow already imprinted in her mind. Every time the woman said or did something it would cause some neurons to fire at the part of her brain that recognised intimate prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nElla wondered at this - she was absolutely certain she did not know this woman. Prior to this meeting they had never seen one another.\r\n\r\nThe only valid explanation Ella could come up with for this feeling that plagued her was that Bill, having met Sue before, must have described the woman in such perfect detail that he had painted the most vivid portrait of her in Ella\'s mind, and Ella had simply forgotten all about it. Yes, that must be it. She felt some measure of relief at this conclusion. She could easily double-check it with Bill later. ','2016-04-16 02:58:08','2016-04-16 02:58:08'),(8,36,'Craig is Mean',NULL,'Ella disliked dealing with Craig. She couldn’t shake the feeling that he just didn’t like her for whatever reason. Ella couldn’t really be a hundred percent sure why without coming right out and asking him, and even then, he definitely wouldn’t admit to it, however, she suspected it was because when they had first met she simply hadn’t acted suitably impressed with him. \r\n \r\nShe had taken over his old position of project manager, the position he had willingly stepped down from in order to become the new QA manager. He had introduced himself to her as an ex olympic ski jump athlete who had won bronze twice before going on to attend Melbourne University, graduating second from the top of the class, before finally joining the company. Ella had made the mistake of responding with, “Oh, bronze twice, huh? Is that why you gave it up?” \r\n\r\nShe had supposed later on after the fact upon further reflection that her response hadn’t quite been the zealous praise and admiration he had been looking for. She was, at times, mildly socially retarded, and if she could have taken that moment back and redone it she would have; however, she simply couldn’t, and even though she had been working there and trying to make it up to him for six years, she still felt that he hated her. \r\n\r\nHe had, from the word go, taken to explaining his particular thoughts regarding the undertaking of every single aspect of the role she now held in painstaking detail. She had persevered with this tedious advice with the polite patience of a psychologist and when he had finally finished she had told him that she would definitely take what he had said on board; however, she really didn’t think she’d have been hired unless Bill thought she was up to the job. He hadn’t seemed happy with that at all. \r\n\r\nSince then, having realised that she’d inadvertently severely wounded his ego, she had tried to overcompensate by being unnaturally nice to him, but even extending a baseline level of courtesy to someone like Craig was a taxing affair in and of itself let alone going above and beyond for him, and while she had tried her very best, it would seem that perhaps no matter how nice she was, she would never reach the level of niceness that he now seemed to require from her for things between them to be \'okay\'. Needless to say, Craig was and always had been her number one source of job-related angst. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t even the one-on-one interactions with him that had the most devastating effect on her - when in a group situation, such as when people loitered around waiting for the lift at the end of the day, or in the kitchen at morning tea, or even in the quiet moments just before a meeting was called to order, he had a habit of laughing a lot when she was around, and it wasn’t a throaty, gregarious kind of laugh, either; it was that soft, arrogant kind of laugh that was barely audible, yet still definitely recognisable as a sneer. \r\n\r\nThose moments when he would sneer at her constantly always put Ella on edge. He just about always failed to laugh at things she would expect someone to laugh at - her attempts at jokes, for example, that other people would laugh at politely simply to break the awkwardness, even if they weren’t that funny. At those moments, Craig wouldn’t make a sound. \r\n\r\nBut at other moments that rude little sneer would suddenly make its appearance; usually it would turn up directly following occurrences that weren’t really funny at all but in some way made her look bad. For example, it showed up once when she had gone to put her coffee cup down on the meeting room table before sitting down and a splash of coffee had swished its way up and over the inner edge of the cup and then down and onto her skirt in a rather embarrassing spot. It had showed up another time wheb she had accidentally misquoted a figure during the meeting - and then again when she had apologised - and then once more when she had stammered due to being thrown off by all the sneering. Another time someone had asked her a question and she had been so absorbed in reading the notes before her that she hadn’t realised she had been addressed - another sneer - and another when she had subsequently apologised and another when she hadn’t been able to answer the question. Another time she was last into the lift and just as the doors were closing someone had wanted in but she hadn\'t been able to hit the lift door open button in time - and of course, had been right there sneering at her expense like he always did as though it was totally appropriate for him to behave in that way. It was unnerving. \r\n\r\nWhen she had first encountered the sneering Ella had imagined that Craig was just dreadfully shy, but as she was exposed to him and the awful sneering more and more she came to realise that he was just plain old mean, and she seemed to be his number one target. She often wondered who he had targeted before she had arrived, if anyone at all. \r\n\r\nHe certainly never targeted any men in the office that she knew about - not their shared superiors nor the men working directly underneath him in his team. However, when the sandwich girl or the massage lady visited the office, the sneer would suddenly come out of hiding again, renewed with vigor after having had a period of respite while he had been surrounded solely by men.\r\n\r\nSometimes Ella liked to daydream about revenge... She would be in the kitchen eating, and in he would come, and it would be just the two of them, and he would spot the box of donuts on the table. She would bide her time and wait until he was in the process of biting into a donut and then do something mildly embarrassing, like spill coffee on her blouse or stub her toe, and at that precise moment, when the piece of donut was right at the back of his throat, just about to be swallowed, he would go to sneer at her and begin choking as the piece of donut went down the wrong passage. He would grab at his throat as he was turning blue, gesticulating wildly, the hue of his suffocating skin making his red hair stand out even more than it usually did, and his eyes would be upon her then, imploring her to help him, his face for once rid of that arrogant expression of smugness and now replaced with one that was made up of a more attractive mixture of equal parts terror and humility. And even though she knew in her heart that if she saved his life it would probably be the one thing that would finally elevate her status in his eyes, it would not be enough to compel her to help the bastard. She wouldn\'t watch him choke, exactly; she didn\'t need to witness the violence of it, she just wouldn\'t make a move to prevent it. \r\n\r\nThat daydream was particularly useful after interactions with Craig and it made her smile to herself so widely and so joyously that other people in the office would give her a quizzical look, wondering what it was she was grinning to herself at like an idiot about. \r\n\r\nIf Craig had been there at those times he would sneer at her. /','2016-04-23 20:56:50','2016-05-18 01:24:05'),(9,36,'Finding Someone (Emotional Abuse)',NULL,'When she found herself in a bad situation, for example, with someone who, while present physically, and doing all the right things and keeping up all semblances of dutiful suitor,  would betray his quietly seething resentment with the odd misogynistic  comment or harsh criticism of her or, in some cases, just blatantly switch off while she was talking, instead of just not seeing the man again, instead of ending it and moving on like a vaguely sane person would, she would unfathomably remain tethered to this person indefinitely. \r\n\r\nEven fully armed with the knowledge that this man had no real feeling for her, that the reason he could wound her so completely with his poisonous darts of criticism was because he was so completely apathetic towards her, it wasn\'t enough to allow her to extricate herself gracefully. For some deeply rooted and  dysfunctional reason she felt the need to not only point out to the man what he was doing wrong, but also to have him admit to not only what he was doing but the reasons why. She would lay it all out in front of him like a hand of solitaire that was one or two moves from being completed - here, she would say, you don\'t really feel for me, and that is the reason you can be so cruel. Move the King of Spades up to the stack and then place the King that was underneath it on the stack and we’ll be done. Unfortunately, the man would not play, for solitaire is a solitary pursuit and one cannot simply ask another to complete the end of one’s game.

She might as well have chosen the gym closest to her apartment, the one near the supermarket that was run by the short middle aged man who always wore a dark navy coloured tracksuit with red detailing and gold chains around his neck.

She joked, \"Perhaps they forget who I am, what I look like?\" \r\nI looked at the business card she had just handed to me. \"Give them your card so they remember your face, then.\"\r\nShe laughed. \"That\'s my business number though! I don\'t want them calling that.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Deborah recounted this story to others, it was a completely different anecdote altogether.\r\n\"This woman we went to school with is so desperate that she hands men a card with a picture of her face on it so they don\'t forget what she looks like!\"','2016-05-19 06:15:04','2016-05-19 06:15:05'),(32,36,'Bad Luck with Men',NULL,'​She\'d never really had good luck with men.\r\n\r\nEven going as far back as high school, when a boy here or there had bothered to show her even the tiniest modicum of interest or consideration, she would be so flattered by the attention that she would then go on to develop an unhealthy obsession, so starved she was of male attention. Even her less attractive friends had boys they liked to torture on a regular basis, all feisty and combative; her quieter friends also had boys that adored them for their fragile beauty and would stare at them adoringly while offering to do things for them...\r\n\r\nBut she had neither an excess of femininity nor an excess of spirit with which to beguile a boy. Thus her formative years had been one long uninterrupted sequence of unrequited crushes.\r\n\r\nShe had been forced to watch patiently, agonisingly as other girls had guys literally throw themselves in front of them. They would almost beg for the girl\'s attention. This begging, of course, always drew out a kind of horrified repulsion in the girl which would become evident soon enough in her resulting ill treatment of the boy.\r\n\r\nShe herself was always too nice to boys... And whether boys were similarly repulsed by her niceness as girls were by their own didn\'t even really matter; after all, in the first place, they never threw themselves down at her feet in willing self sacrifice. So it was more the fact that she had never managed to inspire that kind of reckless adulation. If she had, perhaps she would have had the opportunity to be revolted.\r\n\r\nBut she supposed that she was just too quiet, too unpopular, too ugly...\r\n\r\nAnd now in her adult years she had the same kind of problem. Men, she had decided, must instinctively know that it wouldn\'t be difficult to get her to like them; they knew she was nice, they suspected she was starving, and even if she acted like a modern day Cleopatra, it never quite worked in her favour. The girls she had watched at school had the boys on the line, and it was fun; both parties enjoyed the experience immensely as it played itself out again and again, a daily ritual to be anticipated. But when she tried to turn Cleopatra with a guy the joy would suddenly drain from his face and his jaw would clench almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\nMaybe the guy hadn\'t signed up for Cleopatra. Maybe she was chosen precisely because she was such a pushover, and when she tried to be otherwise, the guys that sought her out didn\'t like it so much.\r\n\r\n[perhaps this is overstating it?]','2016-05-19 06:16:29','2016-05-19 06:16:29'),(33,36,'After the First Date',NULL,'​After their first date, Ella takes a self-driving car home from the restaurant which is located in a suburb that she is unfamiliar with as Peter chose it.\r\n\r\nThe car takes roads that are named with words that warn her against Peter - perhaps street names relating to abuse, cheating, duplicity, manipulation or bad choices, maybe fairly subtle ones.\r\n\r\nLater on, she suspects the marketing company of warning her off him, as part of their plot (her delusion) to keep her unfulfilled by love and in the workforce, but in reality it\'s her subconscious mind having picked up subtle red flags about his true nature.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, her conscious mind creates the delusion that the Magnusson Corporation is the one controlling her fate, but it has really always been a battle between her own differing levels of consciousness. Her unconscious mind, which knows that Peter is abusive and cheating, and believes she deserves to be abused because she isn\'t good enough, and her conscious mind which creates the Magnusson delusion in order to reinstate her commitment to him by propelling her to cling to him and therefore reinstating the deeply held belief that she deserves abuse because she isn\'t good enough.\r\n\r\n---—\r\n\r\nThere could be another woman interested in Peter and she could be a suspect - perhaps the \'perfect\' ex wife, Susan from marketing or even Deborah. \r\nWe could have brief insights into this woman\'s mind - and not reveal who she is until the end. She pities Ella but at the same time holds her in contempt and sees nothing wrong with sleeping with her boyfriend. \r\n\r\nHe of course isn\'t abusive to his mistress. Only to Ella. Because he has her already. \r\n\r\nAlso the Magnusson Corporation is a suspect, because according to Ella\'s delusion, they want to keep her in the workforce, so therefore it\'s in their best interest to get rid of him\r\n\r\nAnd finally Ella herself, having realised that Peter is abusive, having been pushed by him past the breaking point as her conscious mind starts to realise what her unconscious beliefs are and the delusion comes apart.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the delusion more weight hallucinations and voices could be used to corroborate it.','2016-05-19 06:19:09','2016-05-19 06:19:10'),(34,36,'The Little-Boy-Man',NULL,'​As she took her seat and liberated herself from the heavy woollen coat the winter months had sentenced her to wearing, she studied the attractive man before her as discreetly as she could while pretending to read the menu.\r\n\r\nHe was wearing a rather hideous item of knitwear underneath his winter coat - it was as if a ten year old boy had suddenly grown up into a forty-something year old man and his clothes had expanded along with his body. He had a very neat haircut with a very precise part; the longer side flipped over to the left, curling along in a sandy coloured wave. His expensive, designer tortoiseshell glasses, which clashed offensively with the black and white of his knitted jumper, would almost be a requirement for someone in the magazine business, she imagined - they told people that he could very well be a very serious intellectual but that he didn\'t in fact take himself too seriously at all.\r\n\r\nThe whole ensemble gave off the impression of neatness to the point of obsession. It was a slightly out of place naivety for a grown man who wasn\'t gay; he almost could have been dressed by his mother who had bought him the clothing especially for a church outing, except for the fact that the clothes fit extraordinarily well and looked rather expensive.\r\n\r\nShe wondered if he saw himself the way she did right then, as a good little alter boy, fit to be presented to the world, not a hair out of place.

INSERT INTO `writing` VALUES (1,1,'1','Ella is on the run - from the law. She goes to find refuge with her cousin Rita who offers her a place to stay for as long as she needs.','On the Run','2015-12-11 20:05:35','2016-03-10 10:41:19','There were eighteen vertical stripes spanning across each seat of the greyhound bus. Five orange, three yellow, five blue, three red and two grey. Ella had been staring at the stripes on the seat in front of her for the last hour or so as the bus steadily made its way further and further north into the mountains. She closed her eyes, trying to recite the order of the stripes from memory: yellow, red, blue, orange, grey, orange, blue... But as she did, visions of her husband suddenly entered her mind\'s eye - his usually calm, handsome face became vicious and ugly as it contorted with rage, his mouth spitting accusations out at her as the flat of his hand darted towards her face - the vision seemed so real to her that she involuntarily jerked her head away, as if to escape his slap.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes, abandoning the stripes and instead staring at the shadows of the trees outside as they passed by the window. Surely she was close to Natchika now - she\'d already been travelling for several hours, suffering the damp, mouldy odour of soiled upholstery, the faint sounds of unrecognisable music and the rather questionable suspension of the vehicle which became all too noticeable when it ran over potholes and rounded corners.\r\n\r\nThe mountains were a far cry from her home on the beach, and leaving it hadn\'t been easy for her - she loved her house more than anything. She hated having to leave most of her possessions behind, having to pack lean and mean and cram what she had hurriedly chosen into one meagre suitcase. But it had to be done. The alternative course of action didn\'t bear thinking about.\r\n\r\nThe driver slowed the bus down as he turned the next corner. The bus rumbled to a slow stop beside a brightly lit roadside diner. The driver glanced at Ella through his rearview mirror and called out, \"This is Natchika, ma\'am.\"\r\n\r\nThe temperature outside the bus was crisp and so cold that her breaths come out in little puffs of steam in front of her face. The air here, Ella noted, was thick and heavy with the perfume of the surrounding mountain forests. She stood still, allowing herself to enjoy it for a moment. Then she began the arduous task of dragging her luggage into the diner where she took a seat at the counter near the back. She chose that spot because it afforded her a good view of the front doors. She might be sleep deprived and worried out of her mind but no one was going to catch her by surprise if she could help it.\r\n\r\nThe waitress poured her a coffee and asked if she wanted anything else. Ella distractedly shook her head. She was preoccupied with the television set sat high up on a shelf behind the bar. She noted that it was playing reruns of \'I dream of Genie\'. Would the waitress notice if a news report featuring a photo of Ella suddenly flashed up on the screen right then? Would Ella even be recognisable after all the pains she\'d taken to disguise herself?\r\n\r\nShe stared solemnly into the still, dark pool of coffee she hadn\'t touched yet as the bells above the door to the diner jangled a cheerful yet jarring alarm. Ella\'s head shot up as she looked towards the door. A bolt of fear struck at her chest. She watched as two men entered, and sighed with relief - it was just some locals – particularly attractive ones, too, she noted.\r\n\r\nThey took seats at the counter also, but directly opposite from her. While they were both strikingly handsome, one in particular caught her eye. He was tall and lean but also muscular, and his physique made her think that he either worked out at the gym all the time or had a very physically demanding job. He had light sandy coloured hair that was cut very short, and high, flat cheekbones, with a jaw-line that angled down perfectly towards a round, cleft chin. His eyes were the silvery green-blue of a tumultuous ocean on an overcast day and a smattering of salt and pepper coloured regrowth was beginning to spread its way up his cheeks.\r\n\r\nElla was taken aback by how handsome the man was, and when he caught her staring at him, she was so embarrassed that he had caught her openly gaping at him that she almost blushed before hurriedly averting her gaze. He was movie star handsome, that was for sure, but what was he doing all the way out in Natchika? Surely he should be off in Hollywood somewhere trying to make a name for himself, not in some sleepy mountainside town that only had a lumber mill going for it.\r\n\r\nAs Ella got over her shame she peered sideways through her hair at the pair, and noticed that the other man was staring at her now, too. He was slightly shorter than first one, not quite as lean but still solidly built, and where the first man was fair, this one was dark – black hair, dark brown, almost black eyes, and a deep olive complexion. He either worked out all the time at the same gym as the first guy, or else they both had physically demanding jobs at the same place. \r\n\r\nThe first guy stopped looking at her and took out a menu. Ella didn\'t dare look directly at him again for fear that he would catch her staring. Instead she returned to contemplating the coffee she couldn\'t quite bring herself to drink.\r\n\r\n\"She\'s probably here for the job at the Sheriff\'s office,\" Danny said. He flashed one of his warmest smiles her way, but she wouldn\'t lift her head to meet his gaze, so he quickly gave up.\r\n\r\nHunter, while under the guise of inspecting his menu, took this opportunity to scrutinise the woman seated at the counter more closely. Despite the bags under her eyes and the anxiety evident in her face, he could tell she was beautiful.\r\n\r\nShe was staring into her cup of coffee and distractedly tapping her fingers on the counter top. She seemed completely lost in thought; that is, until some slightly startling little noise disturbed her contemplations – a fork dropping, someone coughing, a truck driving past – then her body would momentarily tense and she would dart an accusing glance at the offending sound until she had convinced herself it wasn\'t a threat.\r\n\r\nHis eyes caught sight of the suitcase resting against the counter at her feet. Its zipper wasn\'t zipped the whole way round and bits of cloth were peeking out of the top of it the way handkerchiefs poke out of a suit pockets. He supposed that this woman, whoever she was, had left her home on the spur of the moment, trying to squeeze as much as she could into it, not stopping long enough to bother to make sure it was properly closed.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes moved from her suitcase to her legs he found himself checking out her body. She was very lithe, probably either a dancer or a marathon runner, he guessed. She had very high, firm looking breasts and a tiny little waist set above long, elegant legs. Her hair was very stylishly cut in a rather severe bob, and it was the colour of midnight. Her eyes, as he remembered from catching her gaze, were soft, warm and a chocolate brown colour.\r\n\r\nHe said to Danny, \"I don\'t think so. I think she\'s probably just passing through.\"\r\nDanny shrugged. \"If you say so.\" He made his usual breakfast order to the waitress.\r\n\r\nElla knew the good looking sandy haired man seated at the counter across from her had been staring at her, and she felt uneasy about it. Had he seen a television report about her before coming to the diner this morning? Had he recognised her face from somewhere? Again her eyes darted up to the television set. It was still playing \'I dream of Genie.\'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she realised, she culd just be paranoid; the man could simply have been checking her out. She had been, after all, known to turn heads every once in a while. It was probably lack of sleep that was wearing her down, making her wrongly assume that everyone she had come into contact with since leaving knew exactly who she was and what she was running from.\r\n\r\nReally, there was only one way for her to find out exactly why the gorgeous guy on the other side of the room had been staring at her. She gulped and then turned her head to look over at him shyly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were hard to read; they were expressionless, as were his perfectly chiseled features. They gave absolutely nothing away. Those lovely azure coloured eyes of his bore into hers with a puzzling intensity she couldn\'t understand, his mouth and chin completely unmoving, his long, slender fingers fiddling idly with the menu in front of him.\r\n\r\nElla inhaled sharply as she felt a pleasant sort of thrill shoot down into her lower region. Not knowing why this man was staring so intently at her was actually kind of exciting... What she did know, though, was that the tell-tale signs of recognition were not apparent on his gorgeous face. He probably had no idea she was on the run from the law. She allowed herself to breathe a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nHe continued to stare at her brazenly, not once looking away. His features softened somewhat, and his expression looked more contemplative now, and he tilted his head ever so slightly to one side and narrowed his eyes just a tiny bit. One corner of his mouth lifted by the teeniest amount. It was almost as if he was asking her a question...\r\n\r\nShe felt the stirrings of desire inside of her, rising up through the core of her body, like a deeply sleeping snake that had suddenly been prodded awake, warming up her stomach, her chest, her neck and her cheeks as it uncoiled within her. If she wasn\'t in so much trouble, the answer to his question would have been a resounding yes, yes, yes!\r\n\r\nBut she was in trouble, and she certainly didn\'t need any more of it. So she forced herself to break away from his stare. As she did so, she thought she could hear a soft chuckle – but when she looked up again, he was intently reading the menu, then talking to the waitress.\r\n\r\n\"What was that about?\" Danny asked, his eyes darting from Hunter to Ella, then back again. He tried to catch her gaze but she wouldn\'t lift it from where it had landed, back to the contents of her coffee cup. He was slightly disappointed. And jealous.\r\n\r\nHunter simply smiled to himself. Even if she was just passing through, he doubted she would forget him too quickly. He knew he wouldn\'t forget her too soon, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Don\'t worry, they\'re harmless.\" The waitress smiled at Ella. She must have noticed the attention the two men had been giving her. \"We don\'t get too many new people around here.\" She went to refill Ella\'s coffee and stopped when she realised Ella hadn\'t sipped a drop. Ella looked up at her and smiled. \"I\'m not worried.\"\r\nThe waitress frowned. \"Something wrong with the coffee? Want me to pour you some from a new batch?\"\r\n\"No, it\'s fine, I\'m just...\"\r\n\"Lost in thought?\" The waitress smiled reassuringly at Ella\'s apprehensive expression. Again she felt herself in the grip of paranoia. She stole another nervous glance up at the TV set. She nodded.\r\n\"I can turn that off if it bothers you,\" the waitress told her. \"No one really watches it.\"\r\nElla shook her head. She would rather see the report come up, if it did, than not know about it at all. \"Perhaps if you could just change the channel? To some news, maybe?\"\r\n\"Sure thing.\"\r\n\"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nHunter watched Ella as inconspicuously as he could while she stared nervously up at the TV. His attention was again drawn to the heavy bags she had with her. He concluded that she was too old to be a runaway, and definitely too hygienic looking to be homeless, and considering the fact that Natchika wasn\'t really on the way to anywhere special, she probably wasn\'t stopped there on a layover. She must have meant to stop at Natchika, he decided, despite the fact that there wasn\'t much there – just a small strip of shops, a tiny minimart, a liquor store, a post office, the antiques shop, a gas station and the all night diner out on the highway. The town\'s tiny population was mainly comprised of people who worked at the lumber mill fifteen miles out of town in Narrow Rapids. The place really had no other reason to exist.\r\n\r\n\"She\'s running from something,\" Hunter told Danny quietly. \"She\'s got a hunted look about her.\"\r\nDanny shook his head in disbelief. \"You\'re just imagining things. I\'ll bet you fifty bucks she\'s headed to Beattie\'s Cove to take the job cleaning the Sheriff\'s Office.\"\r\n\"We\'ll see,\" Hunter replied, not convinced.\r\n\r\nHunter and Danny continued to eat their food while Ella\'s gaze remained transfixed by the TV screen. So mesmerised she was, so absorbed in her task of watching every single report to make sure it didn\'t feature her, that she almost didn\'t notice as the two men paid their bill and got up to leave. As the bell above the door jangled, she couldn\'t stop herself from stealing a quick glance towards them – although she probably wouldn\'t admit it to herself, she desperately wanted to see the cute blonde man one last time. As the glass door swung shut behind him he turned his head to look back at her one last time also. She could almost feel her heart skip a beat. Realising that she\'d probably never see this man again, Ella then chose to do something uncharacteristically brave - well, brave for her, at least – she winked at him.\r\n\r\nImmediately after performing this feat of confidence, her body betrayed her in an act of pure deceit – it caused her face to quickly flush with colour and her breathing to became rapid. Her hands, safely hidden in her lap, trembled slightly. She could hardly believe she had the gall to do what she had just done! And how would the man react, anyway? She almost couldn\'t look.\r\n\r\nHunter, however, just laughed, smiling appreciatively at her. She breathed a sigh of relief. He nodded a goodbye at her and then turned around, and then he and his friend put their helmets on and got on their motorbikes. A moment later they had driven off, the loud, rumbling sounds of their bikes slowly receding into the distance.\r\n\r\nAs the sun began to brighten up the day outside, Ella began to see a breathtaking view of the mountains in the far off distance through the diner windows. The sight calmed her somewhat; those large, looming shadowy mountains combined with the tall, green forests nearby made her feel small and well hidden, which was exactly how she wanted to feel right now.\r\n\r\nShe looked at her watch: eight a.m. Was it too early to call Rita?\r\n\r\nElla went to stand inside the phone booth just outside the diner. As she fed it coins and dialed Rita\'s number her stomach began to feel as though it was doing flip flops. It was silly - Rita would be warm and welcoming, as she always was, despite the fact that the two of them had not spoken for three years. Ella was sure she was worrying over nothing. \r\n\r\nHer and her cousin had always been very close. They were surrogate sisters – Ella was an only child and Rita had only had brothers and no sisters, and despite the three years between their ages, the girls had spent their youth playing together outdoors. They climbed trees and rolled down hillsides, picked flowers and tormented insects, built forts and started water fights, all the way up until their tomboy days suddenly ended and the stunningly beautiful Rita began turning heads wherever they went.\r\n\r\nAfter that the girls still played outdoors, running through the tall grasses and trees, but now whilst also being pursued by boys...\r\n\r\nThe phone rang three times before someone picked up.\r\n\"Hello?\" It was Mike, Rita\'s husband. They hadn\'t met yet, but Rita had told Ella all about him the last time they had seen each other.\r\n\"Hey,\" Ella said, her nerves getting to her and her voice wavering. \"It\'s Ella here. I\'m Rita\'s cousin. Is she available to talk?\"\r\n\"Sure,\" Mike grumbled. \"Let me just go get her.\"\r\n\"Thanks,\" Ella replied. Before he put the phone down he said, \"It\'s pretty early to be calling, you know. But I\'ll go get her.\"\r\n\r\nElla silently chided herself for not leaving the call until later. She listened intently to the noises on the other end of the line – thumping, Mike\'s booming voice calling out to Rita, more thumping, a door slamming shut, the revs of a motorbike roaring to life, and then finally Rita\'s voice as she picked up the phone.\r\n\"Ella?\"\r\n\"Rita,\" Ella replied, her eyes filling with tears at the sound of her beloved cousin\'s voice. \"You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice again!\"\r\nRita laughed warmly. \"Ella Bella! How long has it been?\"\r\n\"A few years...\"\r\n\"Wow, time really flies! I can\'t believe it\'s been that long since I left Safety Valley.\"\r\n\r\nElla went silent as her mind sprang back to the home she had left in Safety Valley. She found herself thinking back to the situation she was fleeing from.\r\n\"Ella?\" Rita sounded concerned. \"Is everything okay?\"\r\n\"Oh, Rita...\"\r\n\"What\'s wrong?\" The tone of Rita\'s voice had completely switched now from jovial to serious. \"What happened?\"\r\n\"Oh, nothing too bad,\" Ella lied, the tears flowing freely now. She quickly switched the subject in an effort to distract herself enough to stop the tears. \"Actually, I\'m in town.\"\r\n\"Holy cow! Where are you? I\'ll throw something on and come and get you.\"\r\nElla wavered. She thought of Mike – how his voice had sounded. \"It\'s pretty early,\" Ella said. \"I don\'t want to be too much of an inconvenience to you guys.\"\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Rita replied. \"Mike\'s just gone to work and I\'m up now. Where are you?\"\r\nRelief washed through Ella. \"I\'m at the all night diner on the highway. Thanks Rita. I really appreciate this. I can\'t wait to see you.\"\r\n\"Me either. I\'ll be there in five, okay?\"\r\n\r\nElla watched as Rita parked her old yellow hatchback out the front of the diner. She was already outside with her oversized duffle bags in tow. When Rita laid eyes on Ella again for the first time in three years, she noticed a few subtle changes that had taken place in her cousin\'s appearance. Her hair, which had flowed down in golden brown waves to her waist, was now dyed blue-black and cut in a severe, straight bob that flatteringly framed her jawline. It shone in the morning sun with all the gloss of a high fashion magazine.\r\n\r\nElla\'s frame was more delicate than Rita remembered, too - not that Ella had ever been a big girl, but she had inherited the Connor family curves along with Rita. Now she could easily be mistaken for one of the models in one of those fashion magazines.\r\n\r\nElla thought Rita looked just as she had remembered - her beautiful long, red hair was still as shiny and thick as ever and she still had that stunning hourglass figure that drove men wild. Ella had been jealous of that figure growing up and all the attention Rita had garnered from it, but now she was happy enough with her own body - she had taken up running several times a week, and was satisfied with her own long, lean runner\'s frame.\r\n\r\nAs Rita got out of the car, the two of them immediately broke out into smiles at the sight of each other and almost ran into each other as they went in for a hug. They embraced for several moments, and Ella felt as if a weight had been lifted off of her shoulders for the first time in hours. Rita pulled back and held onto Ella by her shoulders. \"You haven\'t changed a bit!\"\r\n\"You haven\'t either,\" Ella replied. \"Just as gorgeous as ever!\"\r\nRita regarded Ella with concern. \"Let\'s get you back to my place and get some coffee into you! Did you sleep last night?\"\r\n\r\nWhen they got to Rita\'s, Ella was impressed by how beautiful the surrounding scenery of the mountain forest was. They had driven up the mountainside on a road that wound around to the east. Rita had turned into a driveway that extended in a fair way from the road. When they finally reached the end of it, Ella saw the house itself - a long, white weatherboard, probably built in the fifties, was surrounded on all sides by dense forest. Its paint was peeling and its roof was wearing out in spots.\r\n\r\nRita parked in a small clearing at the side of the house. As Ella got out of the car the fresh mountain air hit her with full force. She breathed in its dewy freshness, then looked up. The tall trees reached towards the sky with their long, arm-like branches. Ella once again felt hidden and safe. She looked back at the house.\r\n\r\nTo one side of the house was a caravan, and around the back there was a camper van, and both looked very lived in. To the right of the camper van was a large shed. Ella looked questioningly at Rita.\r\n\r\n\"Hunter lives in the caravan and Danny lives in the camper van. Hunter\'s sister, Sara, lives in the house with us.\"\r\nElla blinked. Rita explained, \"Friends of ours who are staying with us. Wonderful people. You\'ll love them.\"\r\nElla asked uncertainly, \"And all of you live here... Together?\"\r\nRita nodded. \"One big happy family!\"\r\n\"Is there room in there for me?\"\r\n\"We actually do have a spare room for you, luckily enough. Come inside, I\'ll show you.\"\r\n\r\nThe inside of the house was very cosy and more than a little messy with books, magazines, motorcycle parts, makeup, clothes and other things strewn all over the place. Ella dumped her bags on the large old corner settee and took a seat at the kitchen counter. Rita put the kettle on and leaned on the counter across from Ella. \"Well, Ella Bella, not that I\'m not happy to see you, because believe me, I am; but I know you didn\'t come all this way just to catch up with me. So spill it - what\'s going on?\"\r\n\r\nElla took a deep breath. Her stomach started grinding once again as images flashed through her head from the past few days. She tried to decide just how much she should tell her cousin about her current situation. As she thought about what must be happening back at home now, she began to wonder just how big of a mess she had gotten herself into. Was dragging Rita into this mess along with her the right thing to do?\r\n\r\n\"Sam and I are having problems,\" Ella said. She laughed inwardly – she was so grossly under exaggerating that it was comical. Rita nodded sympathetically. \"I\'m so sorry to hear that.\"\r\n\"I just needed some time away from him... I\'m sorry I didn\'t call first. I really just wanted to get away as quickly as I could.\"\r\n\"Oh, that\'s okay. You\'re like a sister to me – you\'re welcome here whenever you want and you can stay for as long as you need.\"\r\n\r\nRita smiled sweetly at Ella. Ella returned the smile, a pang of guilt stabbing at her stomach. While she was relieved that her cousin believed her cover story, she felt terribly bad about lying to her, but she wasn\'t anywhere near ready to tell her the truth yet.\r\n\r\n\"You\'re like the only relative I have right now that will actually talk to me,\" Rita joked.\r\n\"You haven\'t spoken to your parents in three years?\"\r\n\"Actually, they haven\'t spoken to me. Not since Mike and I eloped.\" Rita showed Ella her lovely wedding ring. Ella gushed. \"It\'s beautiful! I just wish I could have been there.\"\r\n\"No, you don\'t,\" Rita said. \"It was just us and a few friends at the courthouse over at Beattie\'s Cove. We signed the documents, the judge pronounced us man and wife and that was it. We went and played pool afterwards. It was nothing like the wedding you and Sam put on.\"\r\n\r\nElla remembered back to her expensive, lavish wedding. Three hundred guests, a swing band, her ridiculously expensive strapless wedding dress and all those delicate pink peonies everywhere... She said a little sadly, \"It just goes to show, the wedding isn\'t really much of an indicator as to how good the marriage will turn out.\"\r\n\"I really am sorry to hear things aren\'t going well... Is there no way you can reconcile?\"\r\n\r\nElla was definitely a hundred percent sure that there was no way her and Sam could ever possibly reconcile, especially not after what she had done to him...\r\n\r\n\"I\'m afraid not,\" she told her cousin. Her cousin rounded the bench and gave her a big, warm hug. After they separated from the embrace, Rita said, \"I guess you\'d be a bit tired after all those hours you traveled on a bus to get here. Feel free to sleep for a while.\"\r\n\"Thanks,\" Ella said. \"I think I do need a nap actually.\"\r\n\r\nRita stood up and took one of Ella\'s bags. \"Come and see your new room.\" Ella grabbed the other bag and followed her. As Ella dropped her bag on the floor and sat on the bed in her new room a wave of fatigue overcame her. She yawned and stretched extravagantly.\r\n\r\nAdding some words to create a writing log.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep tight,\" Rita said, leaving the room and shutting the door behind her. And before Ella could think of a reason not to take a nap, she fell asleep.',4405,'chapter'),(2,1,'2','Ella meets the gang and settles in, but can she manage to keep her secret from everyone?','First Meetings','2015-12-17 14:30:05','2016-02-05 06:05:46','When Ella awoke later, she went out to the kitchen to find Rita, but Rita wasn\'t there; however, she had thoughtfully left a note for Ella on the counter: \r\n\r\nElla, \r\nHad to go do a four-hour shift at the grocery store. Be back at 6. Make yourself right at home. \r\nLove & Hugs, \r\nRita \r\n\r\nThe house was eerily quiet owing to its secluded location - there were no sounds of traffic, no dogs barking nearby, no neighbours talking outside - and the massive shroud of trees that surrounded the place blocked out most of the sunlight which made it rather dark and deary inside. Ella felt very alone. She shivered involuntarily. \r\n\r\nShe forced herself out of contemplation mode and into productive mode. First and foremost, she really needed to take a shower. Three days on the run without access to a bathroom had left her feeling grimy and gross. Her hair was limp from excess oil build up and her nails were starting to accumulate dirt underneath them. She felt far from glamorous.\r\n\r\nShe stripped off and stepped into the shower. The water pressure was less than ideal and it took the hot water unit a fair few minutes to heat up. As she stood naked in the shower trying not to let the icy water touch her bare skin she listened with a certain amount of concern as the old water pipes rattled and shook. Ella thought then of her own bathroom, her own modern house back at Safety Valley. There, she could always make out the sounds of traffic and people talking nearby, and the shower always had a tank of hot water ready. She felt a sudden intense pang of homesickness. It was very silent out here, and very cold. Nothing like her home by the beach at all. \r\n\r\nThen she remembered what had happened between her and Sam, and the homesickness was replaced with fear, guilt and shame.\r\n\r\nAfter getting out of the shower and drying herself off, she got dressed, putting on some tight black jeans and her favourite t-shirt. She applied some make-up, dried her hair and put it up, and began to feel vaguely human again. She made herself a coffee out in the kitchen and sat down on the couch. And promptly started to grow very anxious. \r\n\r\nShe felt out of place. Right now she should be at work making photocopies, filing, answering the phone. Instead she was here, sitting on this old threadbare couch in this dark, dreary house, nothing to occupy her and thoughts of the police busting in suddenly to arrest her haunting her every breath. \r\n\r\nShe got up and went outside. Rita wasn\'t there to talk to and distract her from her thoughts, so she decided to do the only thing she could think of that might help her to get her mind off things a little - take a walk.\r\n\r\nThere was a very faint trailbike track leading into the thick of the forest. She followed it as it snaked downwards and to the left. Ferns and trees intoxicated her with their heady perfumes and birds talked to each other high up in the tops of trees as she passed by. It really was idyllic, and should have been peaceful. If only she could steer her mind away from herself and her troubles for enough time to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nEventually she came upon a gently babbling stream. The noises the water made as it rushed past rocks and down the hill were very soothing. Following it for a time led her deeper and deeper into the forest, which made her feel both safer and yet more isolated and alone all at once. \r\n\r\nShe wondered then how alone she would feel without Rita to talk to - if she did end up going her own way after staying here for a week or so. She would have nothing but her own thoughts to keep her company. She would have to fight hard to distract herself at every moment. \r\n\r\nShe turned around to slowly head back. She didn\'t want to stray too far from the house - she missed Rita already. She hoped her cousin would return soon. She had never felt quite so alone in her whole life since fleeing Safety Valley.  \r\n\r\nAs she reached the beginning of the track again, she could just make out the sounds of singing over the tinny music of a small portable radio. It was playing a Bruce Springsteen song - and Ella thought whomever was singing along to it was doing quite a good job. \r\n\r\n\"I get up in the evening, and I ain\'t got nothing to say. I come home in the morning, I go to bed feeling the same way.\" \r\n\r\nElla exited the forest and located the source of the singing - it was coming from the trailer at the side of the house. A man with short blonde hair stepped outside. He had his back to her so he couldn\'t see her standing there. Ella felt uncomfortable - she wondered if she should announce her presence in some way - a cough, maybe breaking some branches with her shoes. But as she was contemplating it, the man started to take his shirt off. \r\n\r\nShe watched as the muscles in his thick arms bulged into round, hard lumps as he pulled his shirt up over his head. She could see his back now. There was a nice little curved trail leading from his broad shoulder blades down to his lower back, and at his lower back, above his nicely shaped butt, were two dimples that winked playfully at her. He lopped the shirt inside the trailer. \r\n\r\nElla felt slightly ashamed of herself for admiring the well-built stranger in such a blatantly obvious way, but she decided that it was perfectly acceptable as long as he didn\'t spot her. Her eyes were riveted to him as he sat down on a crate and bent over to remove one of his boots. She could tell from this angle that his buttocks were very tight. \r\n\r\n\"Can’t start a fire... Can\'t start a fire without a spark. This gun\'s for hire... Even if we\'re just dancing in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled the other boot off and flung it into the trailer as well. Then he got up and undid the top button of his pants. He turned his body so that his side was facing Ella now. Her heart fluttered - she was conflicted - she wanted to stay there and continue to watch him undress, but there was the danger now that he might spot her. Her breaths came shallow and sharp - partly because she was excited at the prospect of being caught, and party because she was forcing herself to stay perfectly still, hoping that he wouldn\'t see her watching him out of the corner of his eye. \r\n\r\nHe unzipped the zipper of his pants and then pulled them down slowly over his hips. He was wearing tight dark grey trunks, and from that angle, Ella could see the profile of his package, and it certainly seemed like it would not disappoint. She also had a good view of his behind - it looked very firm and very perky. She felt a sudden urge to go over there and touch it just to make sure it was as firm as she believed it would be. \r\n\r\nThe man bent slightly and pulled one perfectly sculpted leg out of the jeans and then the other. Ella smiled to herself. This man was in really amazing physical condition. As he bent to finish getting out of the jeans, the six pack of his mid-section tightened slightly and his pectoral muscles bounced a little, so smooth and round they were that Ella wondered what they would feel like to touch with her hands, what they would feel like to lick with her tongue... Her eyes were then drawn downwards to his thighs and calves - they were so muscular, so firm... He flung the jeans into the trailer. \r\n\r\nHer breath caught in her throat as she realised there was only one item of clothing left for him to remove. Her hand went up to her lips unconsciously as she held her breath and waited for him to remove his trunks. \r\n\r\nSuddenly his head snapped around and he levelled his green-blue coloured eyes at her. His expression was slightly shocked, very serious - then, slowly, it softened. Ella felt her cheeks burning. Her mouth opened, but no words would come out. She was so incredibly embarrassed. She really should have said something earlier to let him know that she was standing there...\r\n\r\nA small smile tugged at one corner of the man\'s mouth. He was enjoying her embarrassment. As he stared at her questioningly he put his hands on his hips and stood a little taller. \"Like what you see?\"\r\nElla\'s mouth fell open even wider. \"I... I\'m so sorry...\" \r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t help but appreciate this new pose, though. Several different muscle groups were suddenly more visible. The man laughed, his smile wide now, and his hands dropped from his hips. \"No, really, did you enjoy the show?\"\r\nElla felt a sudden jolt of adrenalin course through her heart as she retorted, \"I really enjoyed the singing more than anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe man was now embarrassed himself. He laughed uncomfortably. He hadn’t expected her to answer him back and he tended to keep his love of Bruce Springsteen strictly a secret, and his singing even more so. \r\n\r\nElla herself was shocked that she had managed such a smart-ass retort. As little as a week ago she wouldn’t have been able to manage such a feat. She wondered where this new-found courage had come from. \r\n\r\nHunter realised just then that he had seen this woman before - it was the woman from the diner that morning. \"Hey... Didn\'t I see you in the diner this morning?\"\r\nShe tilted her head. She recognised him as well. He was one of the two men from the corner booth at the diner who had been watching her. \"Yes... I recognise you too. My name\'s Ella. I\'m Rita\'s cousin... I\'ll be staying here for a while.\" \r\n\"So you\'re not just some stranger then, out in the wilderness, spying on men while they get undressed.\" \r\nShe shook her head. Another surge of adrenalin coursed through her as she put her hands on her hips. \"You know, most men undress inside their houses...\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed and rubbed at his neck with one hand. He tended to do that whenever he was nervous. Ella thought it was endearing to see such a handsome man get so flustered – and realised with sudden pride that she had never actually managed to fluster one before. She beamed at him. \r\n\r\nHunter thought her smile was wonderful. It made her seem so open and inviting... So different from the haunted woman he had seen in the diner that morning. And he could get lost in those beautiful brown eyes... As he felt a slight stirring in his penis, he was suddenly acutely aware of his lack of clothing. Coughing uncomfortably, he said, \"Well, Ella, I\'m just going to go put some clothes back on now,\" and headed for the trailer door. Ella tried to force herself to look away as he entered the trailer but found that she just couldn\'t. She watched the back of his legs and his perky little buttocks as he climbed the tiny little trailer stairs in his underwear. \r\n\r\nHe called out to her while he was dressing, \"I could use a coffee right about now, what about you, Ella?\"\r\n\"Yes, another coffee certainly wouldn\'t hurt.\" She could hear noises coming from inside the trailer as he got ready – the opening and closing of cupboard doors and creaks coming from the floor of the trailer itself as he moved from one side of it to the other. She called out to him, “Hey, I never caught your name?”\r\n\r\nAs he came out of the trailer wearing jeans and a blue checked shirt, he answered, “Hunter.” He gestured for her to lead the way into the house. \r\n\r\nInside he put the kettle on and asked her how she took her coffee. \"White with one, thanks,\" she replied. When he had made the coffees they sat down on the settee. Her heart fluttered when he sat down no more than a foot away from her. She could smell his aftershave, his deoderant and even a bit of his sweat. She found the combination oddly intoxicating. \r\n\r\n\"So, how long are you staying for?\"\r\nElla took a moment to answer. \"Oh, I don\'t know... A couple of weeks or so.\" She shrugged and looked down at her hands. \r\n\"Ahuh,\" Hunter replied. \"Rita never mentioned you were coming.\"\r\n\r\nElla started to fidget with the coffee cup in her hands, turning it round and round. Hunter remembered the way she had seemed at the diner - very nervous, on edge almost, and tired, like she\'d been travelling for some time. She appeared to him to have almost reverted back to that state now. The playful, flirty woman who had been perving on him outside just before had all but vanished, replaced with this nervous, fidgeting woman who seemed preoccupied with something very pressing. \r\n\r\n\"Where are you from, anyway?\"\r\nElla laughed nervously. \"What is this, twenty questions?\"\r\nHunter was slightly taken aback. He desperately wanted to know what was troubling her but it seemed that she wasn\'t going to trust him – not yet, at least. \"No, not at all. I\'m sorry if I\'m being intrusive.\" \r\n\r\nElla looked over at him. He seemed genuine enough. His gorgeous eyes were locked with hers and she could see that he was wondering about her, that he could sense there was something bothering her. His concern for her, while intrusive and unwanted, also made her feel something else; something deep inside, something she hadn\'t felt in a long, long time. She chose to ignore it. It was a dangerous feeling. It was a feeling that lead to even more feelings and then vulnerability and finally betrayal as the man you thought you knew so well turned into someone entirely different and you couldn\'t understand when or how it had happened. \r\n \r\n\"It\'s okay. I\'m from back west. On the coast. And you? How long have you been staying with Rita and Mike?\"\r\nHunter recognised the deflection for what it was. She obviously wasn\'t going to give too much away and he accepted that. He wasn\'t going to press it any further - he wasn\'t the forceful type. \r\n\"From south of here. Been in this place about twelve months now. It\'s not such a bad place once you get used to it.\"\r\n\r\nHe could smell her from where he sat - her shampoo, which smelled like apples and cinnamon, and something else - the soap she used, maybe. Something sweet and musky. He liked how smooth her skin looked, how pale... He wanted to reach out and touch it, stroke it, see how she reacted to him and take her by surprise when she least expected it by putting his arm around her waist, drawing her to him and kissing her hard on the lips. He looked at her body... He thought it was magnificent, just the kind he liked - athletic and toned, like she worked out a lot, but not too much. He could see the toned curve of her butt through her jeans as she leaned over to put down her coffee, and her firm, round breasts through her t-shirt as she straighted up again. \r\n\r\nShe made him feel things he hadn\'t felt for a long time. In the twelve months he had been in Natchika he hadn\'t met someone as intriguing as her. She had it all - she was beautiful, with a smoking hot body, and humble - she seemed a little shy, a little taken aback by his attentions. He liked that about her. Also that she had a sense of humour. He was used to dealing with women who thought they were God\'s gift and he was over it. He wanted someone with a brain and a personality as well as looks for a change. He gave her a warm smile which she reciprocated. He felt a warmth spread through his chest and down to the pit of his stomach. And then...\r\n\r\nShe picked her coffee cup up again and took a sip from it, and that\'s when he spotted her wedding ring. He felt a wave of disappointment wash through him. The first woman he had met in a long time who actually ticked all of his boxes and she was married. Completely off-limits. He rubbed at his eyes with his fingers. He almost couldn\'t believe how unlucky he was.\r\n\r\nShe started to play with the ring absent-mindedly, twisting it round on her finger with her thumb. She carried on the conversation with him, unaware that he felt like he had crashed to the ground after soaring so high in the sky amongst the clouds. \"Where were you twelve months ago?\"\r\nHunter picked his coffee up and took a sip. His expression grew distant and he was silent for a moment before answering. \"My sister and I used to live in a place called Harmer, about five hundred miles south of here.\" \r\nElla was curious to know more about his past, about why he and his sister had decided to live with Mike and Rita, but she didn\'t want to pry. He suddenly seemed so cold, so closed off... She looked at him but he wouldn\'t meet her gaze anymore. \r\n\r\nShe desperately wanted to lift the tone again, to have him smile at her once more. \r\n\"So... You\'re a closet Bruce Springsteen fan, hey? How come? There\'s nothing wrong with liking the boss.\"\r\nHe smiled at her again, but it was different. It wasn\'t cheeky and playful as it had been before; instead it was polite, almost stand-offish, even. \r\n\"If Danny knew, I\'d never hear the end of it.\"\r\n\"Danny?\"\r\n\"Yeah, he lives here too. In the camper van round the other side of the house. When we first got here we drew straws - I wanted the camper van - the bed is more comfortable and it\'s about five degrees warmer inside. But I drew the short straw.\" \r\n\"Why not a room in the house?\"\r\nHunter shrugged. \"I like my privacy. I lived in a house with my sister for most of my life - I\'m over it.\" \r\n\r\nHe laughed suddenly and Ella was caught up by it, almost infected with it. He was showing her warmth again and it felt wonderful. She stared into his green-blue eyes, admired the way they crinkled at the edges, drawing her into them. Suddenly she felt a burning desire to be held by those strong, muscular arms of his - to be encircled and protected by them. She knew she shouldn\'t think such things about a man she hardly knew but she didn\'t care; she wanted to know what it would feel like to sink into his embrace, to feel the warmth of his chest, the beating of his heart - to be with a man who didn\'t feel the need to dominate her with force; rather, to be with one who would overpower her with tenderness. \r\n\r\nLikewise, with her staring into his eyes he found it incredibly difficult not to just reach out and touch her face, to not just draw her to him, put his hands through her hair and kiss her full, pouting lips. He wanted her, had done since the moment he had seen her in the diner that morning. But it wouldn\'t do. She was taken. \r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat and looked away. She was a married woman. He felt somehow wrong sitting there alone in the house with her. \"Speaking of Danny... He\'s in his camper van. You should meet him. I\'ll introduce you.\" Before she could answer, he got up and walked out the front door. She followed, wondering what had happened. He had seemed so warm just a moment ago; they had been so comfortable with one another. Now it almost felt like he didn\'t want to be alone with her. \r\n\r\nOutside they went round the back of the house to find the camper van. Hunter banged on the door three times. “Yo Danny,” he called out. \r\n“Yo Hunter,” Danny replied from inside the van. “What\'s up?”\r\n“Someone out here you should meet.”\r\n\r\nDanny opened the camper van door and peered out at them. His hair was dishevelled and he wasn\'t wearing a shirt. His eyes were sleepy as if he had just been awoken from a nap. When he spotted Ella he seemed to wake up all at once. He hadn\'t been expecting to see an attractive woman outside his door. \r\n\r\nElla again found herself in the enviable position of catching an extremely good looking guy half naked unawares. She hid her smirk behind her hand. Rather than retreat to put some clothes on like Hunter had, Danny stepped outside and gave Ella a big cheesy grin. “Hey there... Didn\'t I see you in the diner this morning?”\r\nElla nodded. Hunter introduced them like he had promised he would. “This is Ella. Ella, this is Danny.” Ella shook Danny\'s outstretched hand. “Nice to meet you.”\r\n“Ditto!” Danny\'s enthusiasm was both obvious and infectious. Ella found herself grinning widely back at him. \r\n“Ella will be staying with us for a while,” Hunter explained. “She\'s Rita\'s cousin.”\r\n“Oh, hey! That\'s great!” Danny looked Ella up and down. He seemed to like what he saw. Ella laughed at how obvious he was. She hadn\'t met someone so brash before. Just then he pretended to brush something off his naked chest. Ella caught herself following the movement of his hand with her eyes involuntarily. He was just as well built as Hunter was, though a little taller and browner. Danny smirked at Hunter as Ella forced herself to drag her eyes away from Danny\'s chest. Hunter looked mildly annoyed.\r\n\r\n“Say, Ella, ever spent the night in a camper van?” Ella\'s shook her head. Danny grinned. “Want to?” Ella\'s mouth opened in shock. Danny poked his tongue out cheekily. Ella hit him playfully on his rock hard chest. Danny acted like Ella had really hurt him, clutching at the spot where she had swatted him and pouting.\r\n\r\nHunter frowned. Their flirting was putting him in a bad mood. Didn\'t Danny see the wedding ring on her finger? Didn\'t he care? He grumbled, “Do you ever wear a shirt, Danny?”\r\nDanny laughed. “On occasion. But the ladies don\'t like it.” He winked at Ella. Ella rolled her eyes. \r\n“Where\'s Mike?”\r\n“Over in the shed.”\r\n“We should introduce Ella to him as well. And you should put a shirt on.”\r\n“Alright already. Hang on a minute.” Danny puffed his chest out for Ella before disappearing into the camper van only to appear a moment later wearing a light blue polo shirt. “Happy now?”\r\n\r\nThey made their way over to the large shed at the other side of the house. When they got there, Ella saw three beautiful, shiny sports bikes. One was an orange and red Honda, another a black Ducati and the last one a was black and green Kawasaki. There was another hot guy working on the Ducati.  Ella presumed it was Rita\'s husband, Mike.\r\n\r\n“What are you up to, Mike?” Danny asked. \r\nMike replied from behind the bike, “Just changing the oil on my girl here.” He wiped his hands on a rag and lifted his head, spotting Ella. He got up off the concrete floor of the shed and held out a hand. “I\'m Mike. Nice to meet you.”\r\n“Ella.” Ella suddenly felt very intimidated – Mike towered above her – he was an imposing figure. He must have been more than six feet tall. He was also just like Hunter and Danny, in extremely good shape. Ella remembered how he had been annoyed at her calling so early and felt a pang of unease. To break the silence she said, “That\'s a nice Ducati.”\r\nMike nodded proudly. “Sure is. She\'s my baby. Apart from Rita, that is,” he added. He smiled at her, but it was a restrained smile, the kind of smile people reserved for in laws or annoying customers. “What brings you to Greenville, Ella?”\r\nElla swallowed thickly. She had no idea how to answer that question. On the spot she made up a flimsy lie. “I really missed Rita. I just wanted to see her again.”\r\nMike didn\'t look convinced. “If you were planning on visiting, you could have set it up in advance.” He regarded her with suspicion. \r\nShe shrugged. “I\'m very impulsive, I guess.”\r\n“Funny,” he said, “Rita always told me that she was the impulsive one and you were the level headed shy one.” He continued to stare at her. “So how long do you think you\'ll be staying for?”\r\n“Uh... I\'m not sure...”\r\n\r\nHunter could see that Ella was really struggling. He was convinced by now from all that he had seen and heard from her that she was in some kind of trouble. As Mike questioned her, Hunter could see her breathing becoming more rapid and her chest rise and fall with more definition – not that he had been staring at her chest.. Her eyes were very wide and she laughed nervously. \r\n\r\nHunter suddenly felt the need to protect her from Mike. He couldn\'t stand to see her in any kind of distress. So he interrupted. \r\n“I think Ella\'s still probably very tired, Mike. She covered a lot of distance to get here. I just wanted to introduce you to her but I think she needs some rest now.” Ella nodded and looked at Hunter gratefully. Mike threw the oily rag down on the floor. “Sure,” he replied, and gave Hunter a steely glare. Then he went back behind his bike to continue working on it. “See you at dinner, Ella.”\r\n\r\n As Hunter led Ella back to the house, Danny stayed behind with Mike. “See you later, Ella.”\r\n“Later Danny,” she replied. “Later Mike.” Mike merely grunted. \r\n\r\nInside the house, Ella said, “Thank you for doing that.”\r\n“Doing what?” Hunter stopped and turned to look at Ella questioningly. He wondered if she would open up to him now. Ella averted her eyes from his. “You were right - I am quite tired.”\r\nHe touched her arm gently. It felt like a mild jolt of electricity that travelled along her arm and through the rest of her body. “Go lie down, then. Rita will come get you for supper.” \r\n\r\nShe nodded. She almost didn\'t want to move away from him. For some reason she felt incredibly safe around him. But she knew she had to, and so she turned and went to her room. She lay on the bed, touching her arm in the same spot he had just touched her. She smiled, imagining him touching her elsewhere.',4519,'chapter'),(3,1,'3','Desire continues to grow between Hunter and Ella - but will Hunter let himself go after a married woman?','Desire Grows','2015-12-25 13:38:24','2016-02-07 02:49:17','A few hours later, Rita knocked on her door softly. \r\n“Come in,” Ella called out. Rita entered the room and sat on the edge of Ella\'s bed. “How are you?”\r\n“I managed to catch a few hours’ sleep at least. Still thinking about Sam though.”\r\n\r\nIt was the truth – just about every time she had been close to drifting off to sleep, her thoughts had been drawn to her husband  – but not for the reasons Rita probably thought they would be. \r\n“You shouldn\'t be alone right now. It\'s no good for you, especially not at a time like this. Come out and have dinner with us.”\r\n\r\nElla remembered how Mike had acted towards her in the garage earlier. She wasn\'t exactly in a hurry to talk to him again. “Mike was asking me all these questions earlier,” she explained. “I kind of came in here to escape him.”\r\nRita frowned. “He\'s just curious. Don\'t be intimidated by him. If he starts up again, I\'ll talk to him.” She patted Ella\'s arm reassuringly. “Don\'t worry.”\r\n“Thanks, Rita. You\'ve been so kind to me. I don\'t know what I\'d do -”\r\nRita rolled her eyes and then smiled warmly at Ella. “It\'s no problem. I really missed you, you know.”\r\n“Me too.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the gang were seated at the dining table already when Ella followed Rita out to the kitchen – Mike, Danny and Hunter, and also a young woman with hair the same colour as Hunter\'s. Her eyes were slightly bluer than his but there was really no mistaking the resemblance between them – this must be Hunter\'s sister. She smiled at the girl. \"Hello. I\'m Ella. Nice to meet you.\"\r\nSara merely nodded her head in response. She wasn\'t smiling. Her clear blue eyes stared at Ella coldly like she was an unwanted guest. Ella actually had to stop herself from shivering Sara\'s gaze was so cold. It was the least friendly introduction she\'d ever experienced, but she decided she should just brush it off. In any case, no one else seemed to notice. Ella surmised that perhaps Sara was like that towards everyone. \r\n\r\nElla took some food from the bowls arranged on the table to put on her plate – some leafy green salad, some potato salad, a couple of sausages and a chop. They all chomped away at their dinners awkwardly for a few minutes until Rita finally broke the silence, aiming her conversation at Mike. “Did you get your oil change done today?”\r\n“Yep. Only took me a little while too.” \r\n“Great. We should be all set for tomorrow then?”\r\n“Should be. It’s going to be a nice day too...”\r\n\r\nAs Rita and Mike talked, Ella fought hard to stop herself from stealing a glance at Hunter. She was keenly aware of him sitting next to her at the dinner table, his tanned, thick arm only inches away from hers. Again she could smell his cologne – she had smelled it as soon as she had sat down – and it seemed to ignite something deep inside of her. She felt a warm, sensuous feeling start to spread downwards from low in her belly as she thought of how he had stepped in earlier to save her from having to answer Mike\'s questions.\r\n\r\nHis arm kept moving as he cut into his steak, and at one point it brushed against hers; Ella almost shivered as his skin touching hers broke her out of her reverie. \r\n\r\nAs she reached towards the centre of the table to grab the salt in an effort to regain her composure, her eyes caught Sara\'s. The girl was openly staring at her with barely hidden hostility. Ella lowered her eyes to avoid the stare. She wondered what she possibly could have done to upset her. They hadn\'t even really had a chance to talk yet. Again she tried to forget about it. \r\n\r\nWhen another silence descended over the table like a dense fog Sara suddenly asked, “How long will you be staying with us, Ella?” There was hostility in her almost accusatory tone. \r\nRita quickly interjected, “She doesn\'t know yet, Sara. I told you that before.”\r\nSara raised an eyebrow. “Well if it\'s going to be a while, are you going to contribute to the household budget?”\r\nElla stole a glance at Rita, then at Mike. Rita shrugged apologetically but Mike looked as though he was interested in hearing her answer the question. \r\n“It\'s a bit early to be talking about that, isn\'t it Sara?” Hunter said in Ella\'s defence. Ella felt the stirrings of desire burn even hotter in the area below her stomach as once again Hunter came to her rescue. \r\n“I only mentioned it because there\'s a job going in Beattie’s Cove,” Sara replied. “It\'s at the Sheriff\'s Office, cleaning. You could probably have the job if you wanted it.”\r\n\r\nElla almost choked on her food at Sara\'s suggestion. She was on the run from the police… The last thing she would ever want to do would be to parade herself around in front of a Sheriff all day every day! She looked down at her plate, trying to think of what she could say. The awkward silence was almost deafening as everyone at the table stared at Ella, waiting for her to respond. \r\n\r\nShe seemed unable to come up with a suitable reason as to why the job wouldn\'t suit her. After waiting a few moments, Sara said, “Oh, are you too good for a cleaning job? What did you do before, anyway? Something fancy? Doctor? Lawyer?”\r\n“No, not at all,” Ella replied. Her face was turning red and her voice was wavering. “I was in office administration, actually... The cleaning job wouldn\'t suit me because... I have severe allergies... And asthma.” \r\n\r\nIt was the best Ella could come up with. Mike laughed uproariously. Rita shot him a warning look but it didn’t stop him. Sara smirked. Even Hunter was trying not to smile. \r\n\r\nElla was embarrassed, but glad when it seemed like they were clearly going to drop the issue. She sank back into her chair and breathed a sigh of relief. But then Mike said, “If you are going to be here for a while, it might be an idea to see if any jobs around here do actually suit you. You should take a look at the Beattie\'s Cove Gazette.” \r\n“But only if you feel like it,” Rita added. \r\nElla smiled at them. “It sounds like a good idea. I’ll do that.”\r\n“We\'re going for a ride tomorrow on the bikes,” Hunter said then. “Over to Beattie’s Cove. I can bring you back a paper if you want.”\r\n“Oh really? Is everyone going?”\r\n“Yeah, everyone except for Sara, because she\'s working.” \r\nSara scowled. Ella ignored her, replying, “I\'ve never ridden on a motorbike before. Is it as fun as it looks?”\r\n“You should come! You can ride with me,” Danny said. \r\nElla shook her head. \"I don\'t know...\"\r\n\"Oh come on,\" Danny insisted. \"We can\'t all just go out for a ride on a nice day and leave you here by yourself. It\'d be too mean.\"\r\n\r\nHunter sighed loudly. He had actually been meaning to do just that - to leave here in the house by herself - she seemed like she needed time to think and sort through some stuff anyway. But if Danny was going to offer to give her a ride, then he was going to have to step in. Danny was notoriously reckless, and Hunter couldn\'t have it on his head if she got hurt and he could have prevented it. \r\n\r\n“No way. If she\'s never ridden before she should ride with me. Then she has less chance of dying.”\r\nElla\'s eyes widened. “Excuse me?”\r\nDanny laughed. “He\'s joking, just joking. But seriously. Ride with me and it\'ll be a ride you\'ll never forget.”\r\nMike groaned. Rita rolled her eyes and laughed. \r\nHunter said, “Ride with me. I\'m more responsible than he is and I\'ll make sure you\'re safe.”\r\n\r\nElla considered for a moment. She didn\'t like the idea of coming off a motorbike and breaking her neck. But then again, Hunter didn\'t seem all that keen on being around her. She remembered the way he had turned cold when he had seen her wedding ring. She tested him to see if he was serious about the offer. \r\n\r\n“Is it really safe?”\r\n“It\'ll be safe with me,\" he said begrudgingly. \"Unlike Danny, I won\'t go too fast. And you can make me slow down at any time by squeezing my arm, or my sides.”\r\n\r\nElla almost blushed. Squeezing him? She imagined it: her arms would be wrapped around his torso, the insides of her legs would be touching the outsides of his... Their bodies would be close, close enough for her to feel his body heat even, to feel him moving against her...\r\n\r\nHunter said, “That\'s a yes, isn\'t it?” \r\nElla blushed. “Actually I\'m a little scared.”\r\nSara suddenly barked out, “Hunt, I\'ll ride with you, she can ride with Danny.” She gave Ella an icy glare.\r\n“You\'re working tomorrow,” Hunter said.\r\nSara replied, “I can take a different shift. I want to ride with you. Please?”\r\n“Too bad,” he said. “I\'m not letting her go with Danny. He\'s too unpredictable.” \r\nDanny grinned devilishly. “And that\'s exactly why you should ride with me.”\r\nElla shook her head. “No, I think if I were to ride with anyone it\'d be Hunter.” \r\n\r\nShe tried not to notice how uncomfortable Hunter had seemed just then. She had only meant it would be better to ride with him because it would be safer, not that she longed to feel his body up against hers.\r\n \r\n“A wise choice,” Rita said. \r\n“It\'s settled then.”\r\n“Hooray,” Mike said. “Thank Christ for that. Now let\'s clear the table.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Ella awoke with an even bigger knot than usual in her stomach – apart from her standard fear of late of the police tracking her down to this sleepy mountain town and arresting her for murder, she now had the accompanying fear that the impending motorcycle ride she had hastily agreed to last night would result in doom and gloom. \r\n\r\nLately, though, she had noticed that in general she had been taking more risks, standing up for herself more and slowly changing from the perennial pushover that everyone took for granted into someone more sure of herself, someone who was more willing to stand up and assert her rights. \r\n\r\nShe supposed that this had been owing to a general sort of dissatisfaction she had been beginning to feel with her life, due mostly to the draining relationship she had endured with her husband for so long, among other things. Such dis-satisfactions tended to build up and up and up until at last they were released in one big, catastrophic rush, as had happened just before she had left Safety Valley. In any case, Ella found herself excited as well as terrified about the bike ride when she stood beside the road at the end of the driveway next to Hunter and his motorcycle. \r\n\r\nRita, Mike and Danny had already left. Hunter had told them that he wanted to take things slowly with Ella and that they should all just go ahead at their normal pace. \r\n\r\nHunter handed Ella some gloves and a helmet. “Put these on.”\r\n\r\nThe helmet she had a little trouble with; it had a strap that somehow was meant to be secured beneath her chin, but because she had never dealt with one before and also because she couldn\'t see it she couldn\'t manage to get it done up properly. Hunter, having yet to put his own helmet and gloves on, tried to hide his amused smile as he watched her struggle with the strap and loops. Eventually he came to her rescue, his strong, deft fingers pulling and twisting the strap through the loops, touching the underside of her chin now and then, his fingers warm and gentle. The visor of her helmet was still up as he gently wrestled with the straps and as his eyes were intently watching his fingers, she took the opportunity to really drink in the features of his face up close. First she stared at his furrowed blonde brow, at the way the lines between his eyebrows crinkled into a cute little eleven as he concentrated on fastening the strap. Then she looked at the sparkling azure pools that were his eyes - eyes she could almost drown in they were so expressive and beautiful. Her gaze travelled down his long, straight nose then continued down to his soft, velvety lips. She noticed the fine blonde stubble that was starting to make an appearance around his mouth and his finely squared jaw. She imagined how rough it would feel against her cheeks. Then she began to wonder how those soft lips would feel against her own. When his fingers brushed against the underneath of her chin she imagined him gently tilting it up before pressing his lips against hers. She would breathe him in, that musky odour of his, and kiss him back, softly at first and then harder as her desire for him grew and overwhelmed her... \r\n\r\nHe stepped back to admire his handiwork. “There you go. All safe and secure.”\r\nShe smiled. “Thank you.” He flipped the visor of her helmet down before putting his own on, then his gloves. He mounted his bike and kicked it to life; it roared once very loudly, and then a few times more as Hunter hit the throttle, before settling down into a slightly softer purr as it idled. Hunter swung his head around to look at Ella. He gestured for her to get on. She took a deep breath and approached the bike. \r\n \r\nShe swung one leg over the bike, then shifted so she was sitting on the back of it. Hunter patted his thighs with his hands. He wanted her to scooch into him. She complied rather shyly; soon her thighs were pressed up against his and she leaned up against him so that her breasts were pressed tightly against his back. She circled his midsection with her arms and put her head on his left shoulder so she could see where they were going. Beforehand they had agreed on a system; if he was going too fast she was to squeeze his sides really tightly with her hands.\r\n\r\nAs the bike rumbled underneath her, she felt its deep vibrations course through her body; they had an almost numbing, calming effect on her. The bike was so intensely loud that it blotted out all other sounds. As Hunter revved the engine she felt a thrill go through her; her thighs involuntarily tightened around his and she gripped her arms around his midsection a little more tightly. He continued to rev for a while, heating the bike up, getting her used to it, and her anticipation continued to grow. Finally, after he felt that the engine was sufficiently warmed up, he took off slowly, manoeuvring the bike onto the road. \r\n\r\nAs Ella felt the initial acceleration of the bike as it moved forward a wave of fear rippled through her body; her hands gripped Hunter\'s sides tightly. He glided the bike at a leisurely pace around the first corner. Ella leaned into the corner slightly with him despite every fibre of her being telling her to lean the other way. Again she felt the fear of not being in control clench her stomach but as the bike mounted a small crest and then dipped into a slight valley she momentarily felt weightless; the feeling caused a sudden bubble of joy to rise up from her stomach all the way to her head where it popped and made her a little dizzy; she began to laugh ecstatically, and Hunter felt her laughing against him and started to laugh himself with relief. He was glad she was enjoying herself; she seemed so tense and worried, and the last thing he wanted to do was add to that.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely autumn day. Fallen leaves littered the roadside as the trees malted in preparation for spring. The smell of the mountain forest air was fertile and fresh. As they rode further and further up the mountainside the smell became denser and thicker still. Ella began to enjoy sensation of the air rushing against her body. In fact, she almost felt like she didn\'t have a body at all, that she was just a disembodied soul flying along the mountainside in search of a body to possess. \r\n\r\nBut every now and then Hunter would go just a little bit faster when he felt Ella was up to it and a new thrill would sing through her. She would grip him tightly again, her thighs tightening around his, her breasts pressing even more tightly up against his back. But he was so cautious, so careful and in control that she would quickly loosen up and trust in him completely again. In this way she found that she was able to let herself go and enjoy the experience fully. \r\n\r\nAs she found herself completely in the moment, she found that the past and the future no longer existed. All that she felt was the gentle rising and falling of the bike as it crested small hills, and their weight shifting in unison with the bike as they rounded the curves of the road. All she could smell were the rotting leaves and dense, damp forest all around them. All she could hear was the deep rumbling of the motorbike as it echoed against the jutting rocks of the mountain walls. All she could see ahead was the road as it rushed to meet them, the white lines blurring and the sun spotting it now and then as it was able to peak through the high branches of the trees surrounding them.\r\n\r\nEventually they came to Beattie’s Cove. It was considerably larger than Natchika and housed such conveniences as a primary school, a regular sized supermarket, a few restaurants by the waterfront, some clothing stores… Just about everything you’d expect from a town of this size. It had an air of commerce about it, and while Ella wouldn’t exactly call it a bustling metropolis, it definitely felt much more inhabited than Natchika had.\r\n\r\nHunter pulled over and parked the bike outside the newsagent. Ella disentangled her legs from the bike and gingerly removed her helmet. Hunter switched the bike off and pulled his helmet off as well. Ella was grinning from ear to ear. \r\n\r\n\"Wow,\" she said. \"I feel so relaxed.\"\r\n\"Cheaper than a masseuse,\" Hunter replied. \r\n\r\nHe was surprised to find himself so happy to see her happy. He had almost forgotten the fact that she was married. Instead, thoughts of how it had felt to have her pressed up against him flooded his mind. It had been nice to have her so reliant on him as he controlled the bike. It had been a long time since he had given anyone a ride on the bike, let alone someone so attractive. With every turn they had taken he had been able to feel her move right with him, and every time she had squeezed him he had felt the tingles of desire shoot through him. It had taken all of his willpower not to just pull the bike over, grab her and lift her off of it, and give into his growing desires by the side of the road. \r\n\r\nWithout really meaning to he felt himself return her smile. \r\n\"I can almost still feel my legs vibrating.\" She laughed. \r\nHunter took his gloves off and stepped off the bike. \"I thought you\'d like it... You seemed like you needed something to cheer you up.\"\r\n\r\nElla\'s face lost its smile as she again remembered all the things she was running from. Her eyes stared off into the distance. \"Yeah...\" \r\nHunter immediately regretted bringing up Ella\'s troubles. He tried to lighten the mood again. \r\n\"If you\'d ridden with Danny it might have gone a little differently.\"\r\n\r\nElla simply nodded, giving him a distracted smile. She was thinking about Beattie’s Cove - with its higher population and Sherriff’s Office, which meant police officers – which meant more chances to be spotted should an APB be out on her. She dug into her backpack, fishing out a pair of large sunglasses which she put on despite the fact that the sun was barely visible through the now overcast sky. She also put a scarf over her head. Hunter watched her. A nagging feeling of suspicion tugged insistently at his conscious mind. He remembered: something about this chick wasn’t quite right. He wished he knew exactly what it was. \r\n\r\n“Are head scarves all the rage back west? And what’s with the sunglasses?” His voice was cold now, probing. Ella shivered. “Photosensitivity,” she replied quickly. She looked away from him. “And yes, scarves are very in right now. Let’s get this paper.”\r\n“Okay,” Hunter said, not quite convinced. “Come on then.” His voice sounded very cold now, distant. Annoyed. Ella told herself it didn’t matter. He was nothing to her anyway; why should she care? \r\n \r\nHe led her to the newsagent. Inside, he handed her the Beattie\'s Cove Gazette which would contain all the region’s job openings. “This is what you wanted isn’t it,” he said coolly. She looked at the paper. The front cover boasted a story about a local woman who had broken the state record for knitting the largest ever hand-made blanket. She had then donated the blanket to the local pound. Ella smirked. It was kind of sweet, kind of odd – and totally unlike anything that would have featured in the newspaper at Safety Valley. \r\n\r\nHunter noticed the smirk and looked at the front page. Even though he saw it the way she must see it, he felt a shot of indignation shoot up his spine. Who the hell was she to make fun of this region, anyway? The Queen of England? \r\n“What’s so funny?”\r\nElla wiped the smirk off her face. “Nothing.” He glared at her for a moment before deciding to let it go. They walked to the counter so she could pay for the paper. \r\n\r\nA woman and her son were in front of them. His nose was leaking like a bad faucet and he kept wiping it on his sleeve. Ella hung back a little. She glanced at Hunter but he didn’t seem to notice – he was too busy looking out the window, avoiding her gaze, probably, she decided. The kid turned around to them and looked up first at Ella, who inched back even further when she saw how red and watery his little eyes were, then at Hunter, who still didn’t notice him. He tilted his head back and Ella covered her face with one gloved hands in anticipation, and tugged at Hunter’s arm with the other as she could see what was coming – she again looked at Hunter, but Hunter was steadfastly staring out the window, avoiding her gaze, ignoring her tugging at his arm – and then the child let out the world’s most violent sneeze - and all the snot he hadn’t managed to transfer to his sleeve sprayed up at Hunter’s face like a lawn sprinkler’s load. \r\n\r\nHunter flinched, his expression one of pure disgust. Ella tried hard not to laugh – it served him right – she had tried to warn him, but he’d chosen to ignore her. \r\n\r\nThe boy’s mother turned around. “Oh, I’m so sorry,” she said, handing Hunter a tissue from her shoulder bag. \r\n“Don’t worry about it,” Hunter replied, using the tissue to wipe at his face. He was definitely grossed out. The woman guiltily turned back around, ushering her son away from them. \r\n\r\nOutside, Hunter found the public toilets and stomped inside to wash his face. Ella waited patiently for him, her back to the Sheriff’s office. When Hunter came back out, he seemed a little less indignant; his expression was definitely a little softer. “You tried to warn me,” he said. Ella nodded. He laughed. “I should have turned and looked when you tugged at my arm. Oh well.”\r\n\r\nHe stretched his arms out in front of him and took a look around at the town. He didn’t really feel like getting back on the bike just yet. Getting back on that bike meant having her legs wrapped around him again, having her arms around him again. Having to smell her perfume and shampoo, having to stop himself from turning around on the stationary bike so that he was facing her and kissing those pouty little lips, darting his tongue into them, feeling her tongue react to his, their lips softly touching; grabbing those pert little breasts, feeling how round and firm they were, squeezing the nipples and feeling her react to that; grabbing that tight little ass of hers and giving it a squeeze. \r\n\r\nHe had to remind himself, yet again, that she was a married woman. He shook his head, trying to manually shake the images of her out of his mind. It was such a nice day - he meant to enjoy it, even if it was in the company of someone else’s wife. “Do you feel like grabbing a bite to eat?”\r\n\r\nElla looked around. The Sheriff’s Office was right in the centre of town. A police range rover was parked right out the front of the office and there was a large window in the front of the building through which Ella imagined the Sherriff could keep a constant omniscient eye on the town. \r\n\r\n“I’m not that hungry, actually,” she told Hunter. Hunter followed her gaze. “Okay,” he replied, noticing where she had been looking. She quickly turned her head turn away from the Sherriff’s Office, hoping he hadn’t noticed what she’d been looking at. \r\n\r\nIn fact, Hunter had noticed. He looked again at her wedding ring. It wasn’t his problem, he reminded himself. Whatever it was, whatever she was doing, it wasn’t his concern. He’d known from the first moment he’d seen her in the diner that she was running from something – running from someone, he decided now. Maybe she’d stolen her old man’s money. That would explain her dislike of being around the police. Maybe she’d taken all his credit cards. Maybe it was something even more sinister that she’d done… Who could say? \r\n\r\nHe didn’t know this woman, didn’t know what she was capable of. She was related to Rita, sure; but people tended to view their loved ones through rose coloured glasses. Maybe Rita forgave Ella her transgressions. Or maybe… Maybe Rita didn’t know Ella as well as she thought she did. \r\n\r\nEither way, Hunter wasn’t going to allow himself to get drawn into this woman’s drama. He had experienced the sting of betrayal himself many years ago and actually, he felt sorry for her husband. \r\nIt was for that reason that he felt like interrogating her until she told him what was going on. \r\n\r\nHe mentally pictured in his mind how that might go down. He wouldn\'t take her back to the house, but instead drive her out to the forest again, finding a secluded clearing with a smallish but sturdy tree in it. He’d force her to take off her jacket and sweatshirt until she was just in her jeans and silk blouse. She wouldn’t be wearing a bra underneath. He’d force her down in front of the tree onto her knees. He would then bind her to the three with some thin, silky rope. He would make sure each leg was straddled around the tree, the feet tied together behind it. \r\n\r\nShe would be looking up at him from that vulnerable position, her eyes large and round. She would have to tell him everything he wanted to know. He wouldn’t even have to pinch her nipples hard, just gently brush against them, as they would be really straining beneath the silk blouse, rubbing up against it, pumped full of blood, feeling every sensation a hundred fold. He would unzip her jeans and feel between her legs, the moistness, the heat. He’d grab her throat; not really meaning to hurt her, just scare her a little. “Tell me what’s going on Ella… So help me…”\r\n\r\nAgain, he had to force himself to not think such things about this woman. He shook his head and almost laughed to himself. This was crazy! It was like he was a teenage boy again. He had to get his bearings. \r\n\r\nOnce the blood started to rush back into his brain again, he told himself that it really wasn’t his place to get involved – she was Rita’s cousin, and Rita was Mike’s wife, and Mike meant the world to Hunter and he wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise their relationship. \r\n\r\nMike had been there for Hunter and Sara when no one else had been. He owed Mike his life. And for that reason he wasn’t going to turn Ella in, wasn’t even going to question her, despite the fact that he was quite sure she probably deserved whatever was coming to her. He gave her a cold stare. \r\n\r\n“That’s fine. We’ll just head back then.” His tone was as cold as ice again. It didn’t stop Ella from feeling relieved that they didn’t have to stick around town, though. “Thanks.” \r\nHe added, \"I really don\'t want to spend any more time with you than I have to, anyway. From this point on it might be better if we just avoid each other.\"\r\n\r\nElla felt like someone had shot her in the heart. She blinked a few times, tears threatening to spring from her eyes. She was speechless. She stood there, frozen like a statue, wondering why in the world it had hurt her so much to hear him say that. Hunter was already busy putting his helmet and gloves back on. In an effort to distract herself from crying, she tried to tie the straps into the loops underneath her helmet. Unlike the first time, this time she actually managed to do a decent enough job that she didn\'t need Hunter to fix it for her. She got on the bike behind him. \r\n\r\nThe clouds in the overcast sky above them continued to grow darker and larger with each passing minute. The temperature had dropped a few degrees, and the air that rushed against Ella’s body was slightly chilling to her now. She could hear the distant claps of thunder even through the roaring engine of the bike so loud and violent they were. It was only a matter of time before it rained. Ella didn’t think they’d make it back to Natchika in time. \r\n\r\nAnd she was right. The onslaught of rain was both sudden and extreme. It attacked them in torrents that seemed to come almost directly at them at a sixty-degree angle. Hunter had to spend all of his concentration on not allowing the bike to slide out from under them. He took every corner very carefully, and was alert for every crest. Finally, after what felt like hours caught in the torrential rain, they made it back to the house. \r\n\r\nThey were drenched. As they walked into the lounge-room Hunter peeled off his leather jacket to reveal his white shirt – completely saturated and clinging to his masculine form like cling wrap. \r\n\r\nElla took her jacket off to find the same thing – her white silk blouse was completely drenched and sticking to her skin also. The delicate white lace bra she wore underneath it was drenched also, and the dark areolas of her nipples were clearly visible through the soaked material. \r\n\r\nHunter felt his groin stir again as he noticed Ella’s delicate, perfectly round breasts. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Ella found it incredibly difficult not to look at Hunter’s large chest through his soaked shirt. She quickly averted her gaze as she went to the hall closet to fetch them a couple of towels. When she had returned, however, Hunter had taken both his shirt and his jeans off. Her mouth fell open slightly in shock. Hunter shrugged, taking one of the towels out of her hands. “Don’t look so shocked. You’ve seen this before. The only difference this time is that I know you’re watching me.”\r\n\r\nElla closed her mouth. She suddenly felt ashamed of having spied on him the other day without his knowledge. She nodded. “You’re right.” She wanted to take her own blouse off too; the way it clung to her skin was beginning to make her feel uncomfortable, and she was aware of Hunter’s eyes on her chest. She covered herself with the towel so he couldn’t stare any more. \r\n\r\nHunter began to pat his chest with the towel. He dabbed at his broad shoulders and neck first, then made his way with the towel down each of his arms, soaking the beads of water off the smooth, bulbous muscles. Then he patted at his pumped up pectoral muscles, then down to the smooth rounded ridges of his delightfully tight six pack… \r\n\r\nThen he sneezed violently, quickly shaking Ella out of her trance. He buried his face in the towel. He groaned. “That kid…”\r\n“Go take a shower,” Ella ordered. \"You need to warm up.\"\r\nHe shook his head. “Ladies first.” \r\n\r\nHis gaze again travelled to her breasts, visible again through her soaked shirt since she had absently lowered her towel while she had been transfixed by him towelling himself off. She blushed. \r\n“You really should go first,” she told him. “You might end up sick like that boy.” \r\nHer nipples began to harden under the scrutiny of his gaze. The corner of his mouth lifted in a tiny smile and he looked up into her face again. “No way. I insist – ladies first. Please.” \r\n\r\nShe sighed. She knew it was probably going to be useless trying to argue with him, even though he was being silly – he really should take the first shower if he was on the precipice of becoming sick. But she knew he would probably just keep insisting, being the ultimate gentleman that he was. He was just that type of guy. So she gave in to save them both the trouble of arguing. \r\n\r\n“Alright,” she said, and went to the bathroom to take a shower. As she lathered the suds onto her naked body, she tried really hard not to think about how she had caught Hunter openly staring at her breasts. It was a little odd that he showed absolutely no interest in her, to the point of being outright cold towards her at times, yet he was quite alright with ogling her private parts when he felt like it. \r\n\r\nShe imagined then what it would be like to have him in there with her, to be able to lather the soap up all over his perfect body. She\'d start by covering his magnificently chiselled chest with it and then work downwards, where she would lather it up over his wonderfully bumpy six-pack, then his lovely tight stomach and finally down even further... She would work the soap up into a frothy lather over his pubic mound, and then finally work up the nerve to slide some of those suds up and down his hardened manhood… \r\n\r\nShe blinked hard, and reminded herself that the man simply wasn’t interested in her and it was quite insane of her to continue to think about him in this way. The only reason he’d been staring at her breasts so intently was because they were there in all their rain soaked glory, impossible for any full blooded man to ignore. She reminded herself then that he was in the lounge room at that very moment, probably on the way to being sick from that kid sneezing all over him, and here she was, fantasising about him all naked and hot in the shower with her. \r\n\r\nShe pulled herself together and stepped out of the shower. She called out, “Hunter, the shower’s yours now, I’m going to my room to change.” And she stepped into her room to dry off and find some clean clothes to change into.  \r\n\r\nWhilst in there she firmly reminded herself how wrong it would be to continue to have inappropriate thoughts about the gorgeous man out in the living room. \r\n\r\nWhen she was done, she went out to the hall. Oddly, she couldn’t hear the shower running. She went into the lounge-room. There he was, lying on the couch, seemingly naked, nothing but a towel covering him, shivering violently. His lips had a bluish tinge to them and his eyes were closed. \r\n\r\nShe walked over to him and felt his skin - it was freezing cold. He must have developed hypothermia, firstly from being stuck in the rain for so long and secondly for being stuck wearing wet clothes and being left out here in this cold room while she got to take a nice warm shower. Ella felt pretty guilty for taking that shower first... She decided she should have been more insistent with him. \r\n\r\nHis eyes opened then and he smiled, a dazed, far away kind of smile, the kind someone in the grips of a serious illness might give. He seemed as though he was looking right through her, as though she were a transparent curtain. He grabbed her left hand clumsily. “Don’t leave me again,” he said. He looked down at her hand, shaking violently as he did so, specifically at the gold ring on her ring finger. Despite his shaking, he managed to twist it. She was kind of taken aback – after all, it was something she did a lot, absent-mindedly – twisted the damn thing with her thumb. Now he was doing it for her. She wondered if he was doing it because it was something he saw her do, or if he just felt like doing it. \r\n\r\nShe went to grab a duvet for him from the closet but he gripped her hand even tighter. \"Don\'t go... Please.\"\r\n\"I\'m getting you a blanket,\" she replied. \"I\'ll be right back. I promise.\"\r\nHe nodded, and she grabbed the duvet and brought it back to cover him with. Then she went to the gas heater in the corner of the room and tried to get it going but it wouldn\'t ignite. It must be out of gas, Ella realised. \r\n\r\n“Hunter?” This time he didn’t answer. His eyes were closed now. She wondered if she should try to wake him. If he actually did have hypothermia like she suspected then he was in great danger. Worse still was the fact that there wasn\'t a car around for her to drive him to the clinic in and she sure as hell couldn\'t handle the weight of his motorbike herself AND manage to lift him onto the back of it on her own. Her only options at this point were to call an ambulance or try to get his body temperature up herself. \r\n\r\nShe shook him gently. He groaned. He wasn\'t opening his eyes. \"Hunter? Can you hear me?\" \r\nNo response, just more shaking. His teeth were chattering too. She started to panic. She decided she should try to get his temperature back up herself - he would probably do the same for her if their roles were reversed. \r\n\r\nShe stripped off her clothes until she had nothing but a bra and underwear on. She lifted the duvet and lay down next to Hunter on the couch. It wasn\'t a large couch so she had to position herself right up against him. As she was doing this she snuck a peak at his package - and was not disappointed. She put one of her legs over the top of one of his and the other in between both of his legs. She put one of her arm\'s up against his chest and the other around him and squeezed tightly. She nuzzled her head into his icy cold chest and hoped with everything in her that it would be enough to stop him from shaking so violently. From there she could feel his heart beating fast and hear his shallow breathing.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes his teeth stopped chattering and his shaking wasn\'t so fierce any more. His breathing was no longer shallow and his heart rate seemed back to normal. Ella breathed a sigh of relief. Her unorthodox plan had worked. \r\n\r\nAfter another ten minutes his skin was beginning to warm up. She stroked absent-mindedly at his pectoral muscles with the hand that was pushed up against his chest. It felt so smooth and firm, and definitely warmer than it had been. Her lips were against his throat... She softly kissed it knowing that he wasn\'t aware of her presence and that she would get away with it. She could still smell his aftershave and feel some of the tiny little prickly hairs that were growing back on his throat after his last shave. She kissed his throat some more and even let her tongue dart out to lick at him a few times, just to check that he was still out to it. No response. She was relieved. \r\n\r\nBut then Ella wondered if at this point she should leave him alone... She quickly forced herself to stop stroking and kissing him. It seemed that she had saved him from dying of hypothermia and it was his wish as they had left Beattie\'s Cove that they spend less time together, and she decided he probably wouldn\'t approve of them spending time together like this, anyway. \r\n\r\nShe began to make a move to get up but just then a hand snaked its way under her side. The arm it was attached to went around her waist and held her against him tightly, its hand pressing firmly in the space just above her buttocks. His other arm came around from behind him and cupped her breast. She could feel the heat start to flush through him as it also flushed through her. She decided he definitely wasn\'t going to die of hypothermia now. \r\n\r\nShe tried again to get off the couch but she really couldn\'t move. He was holding onto her too tightly. \"Hunter?\"\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t answer. But the arm he had sneaked in underneath her moved its hand to graze leisurely across her buttocks. The other hand started to squeeze her breast. She felt a stirring in her genitals but then she also suddenly felt a stirring directly in front of her against her stomach as something of his began to swell up with blood... \r\n\r\nHe had woken up to Ella almost naked wrapped around his body... The smell of her hair intoxicating him, the feel of her lips against his throat and her hands stroking his chest driving him wild. He had no idea how this situation had come to be but he certainly wasn\'t hating it, that was for sure. She had licked him and spoken his name and he had done everything in his power to stop himself from reacting to her - he didn\'t want her to stop whatever it was that she was doing, whatever the reasons she had for doing them. \r\n\r\nHe felt his hands moving to cup her breast and squeeze her butt almost involuntarily, as though they had a mind of their own. He half expected her to slap him... But she didn\'t; instead, she seemed to enjoy the attention for a while, if the increased frequency of her stroking and kissing him was anything to go by. \r\n\r\nBut then she had tried to move away... And he had pressed her towards him more firmly. She couldn\'t go yet. He groaned. It was terrible of her to tease him like this. He could feel his penis becoming engorged at the feel of her against him...\r\n\r\nShe could feel him growing against her too, and his gentle yet firm stroking of her buttocks grew slightly firmer and quicker. He began to gently roll her nipple between his thumb and forefinger. She gasped in pleasure and surprise. \"Hunter! What are you doing?\"\r\nHe groaned. She wondered if he was still delirious from having hypothermia or if he had come to. \"Are you with me yet, Hunter?\"\r\nNo response. She had no idea if he knew what he was doing. She could feel herself getting wet between her legs through her silk underwear and knew that he could feel it too as her legs were straddling his thigh... \r\n\r\nShe had to get out of this mess! What if he suddenly came to and realised what was happening? He would blame her for it! \r\n\r\nShe moved her body away from him. She carefully removed his hands from her body parts with her own and then took her legs back from straddling his. Unfortunately she did this so deftly that she toppled backwards unceremoniously off of the couch and onto the cold, hard floor of the living room. \r\n\r\nHunter used every ounce of willpower he had within him to stop himself from laughing at her falling backwards off the couch. He kept his eyes and mouth clamped shut as he heard her get up off the carpet and grab her clothe and start putting them back on. He decided then that he should stage his coming to - for her benefit - just to make sure that she wasn\'t embarrassed around him in the future. He didn\'t want her to know he had been aware of what had just happened.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes slowly, squinting as if adjusting to the light. \"Ella?\"\r\n\"Hunter! You\'re awake. How do you feel?\" She sounded slightly exhilarated. He stopped himself from smiling at that. \r\n\"I\'m okay, why?\"\r\n\"You had hypothermia,\" she told him, watching him with concern. He believed her - he suddenly remembered after she had gone to take a shower and he had taken his cold, wet clothes off that he had started shivering excessively. After that, though, it was a blur until he had come to with her almost naked lying against him... He supposed she had done that for him to bring his body temperature back up. He felt a surge of gratitude for her then. But still... Kissing his neck and stroking and straddling him weren\'t part of the hypothermia treatment plan...\r\n\r\n\"Did you help me?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" she said a little awkwardly, \"There\'s no car here to take you to the doctor, and I couldn\'t handle the bike, so I...\" She trailed off, looking away embarrassedly. \r\n\"You stripped off and warmed me up,\" he said, smiling. She nodded. \r\n“Thanks,” he said. \"I appreciate it.\" \r\n“It’s no problem,” she said, “Actually, I feel partially responsible for you getting sick. It’s my fault we went into the newsagents.”\r\n\r\nThe front door opened then, startling Ella, who was beginning to feel a little guilty about the encounter she had just had with Hunter. She turned to look at who it was. It was Sara, and as Sara threw her bag down onto a chair she shot Ella an angry glance. “What the hell are you doing?”\r\n“He’s sick. I was just trying to make sure he was taken care of.” Ella’s words fell on deaf ears as Sara simply ignored her. She walked over to them and pushed Ella aside, kneeling beside her brother herself. \r\n“I’m here now,” Sara told him, taking his hand in hers. “Don’t worry.” She looked up at Ella. “I can take care of him now. You can go and do… Whatever it is you do.” As she said the last part she looked at Ella’s wedding ring. Then she turned back towards her brother.\r\n\r\nElla was hurt, confused – she wanted to say something to Sara, but wasn’t quite sure what she should say. Sara was completely focussed on Hunter then, anyway, and even if Ella could find the exact right words to say to the girl, she doubted they would be received that well anyway, so she went back to her room to mull things over.\r\n\r\nShe wondered, not for the first time, who these siblings really were, where they had come from, and why they seemed to be a part of Mike and Rita’s family now. They were so close, and Sara so fiercely protective of her brother… \r\n\r\nShe shook her head. She might never find out. She certainly knew what it was like to keep a secret. Do do do.',8390,'chapter'),(8,1,'4','Ella looks after Hunter while he\'s sick','Nursing the Sick','2016-01-22 15:02:35','2016-02-01 02:50:38','The next morning, by the time Ella made her way sleepily out to the loungeroom, Mike, Rita and Danny had already left for the day. She saw that Sara, however, was kneeling beside Hunter, who was still sick and laid up on the couch. Sara looked up when Ella approached. She looked tired, the bags underneath her eyes still visible despite the makeup she\'d applied in an effort to cover it up. She was dressed in her \'Beattie\'s Cove Feedbag\' work shirt and Ella guessed she would have to go to work soon.\r\n\r\nElla didn\'t say anything to Sara, afraid the girl might snap her head off if she dared. Instead she made a bee-line straight for the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. When she was done she sat at the counter where she had planned to spend the morning looking at the job listings in the paper she had bought the day before. If any looked good, she\'d apply. \r\n\r\nSara entered the kitchen just as Ella opened the paper. Ella noticed though that her demeanor was different than usual; instead of glaring at her, the girl was actually wringing her hands nervously - something Ella had certainly never seen her do before - and as she opened her mouth to speak to Ella, and Ella looked at her questioningly, she suddenly must have thought better of it and instead quickly turned around to fill her thermos with coffee. Ella turned her attention back to the paper. \r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two, Sara cleared her throat, causing Ella to look up again. Ella took the risk of having her head bitten off - curiosity won out - and asked her, \"Did you want something, Sara?\" \r\n\"Now that you mention it...\"\r\nElla waited patiently for Sara to speak. \"I have to go to work now,\" Sara said, glancing back over her shoulder towards Hunter. \"Hunter\'s still sick, though, and I noticed yesterday that you tucked him in and gave him pills for his fever.\"\r\nElla nodded. \"He was pretty sick. I didn\'t want him to get worse than what he was.\"\r\nSara looked down at the floor. In a small voice she said, \"Thanks for that. I really appreciate it.\"\r\n\r\nElla\'s mouth dropped open in shock. Did Sara, Hunter\'s abrasive, rude little sister, the same girl that seemed to hate her for absolutely no reason at all, just sincerely thank her? She allowed herself to smile - a small, amused smile. \"You\'re welcome,\" she replied.\r\nSara looked relieved. She continued, \"If you could just make sure he\'s okay today... I wish I could stay and look after him myself but my boss won\'t let me take the day off... And Hunt is so stubborn, the minute he feels even slightly better he\'ll think he\'s well again and he\'ll get up and overdo it and probably end up even sicker.\"\r\n\"It\'s fine. I\'ll make sure he\'s okay.\" Ella gave Sara her most convincing smile. She never thought she\'d live to see Sara acting so concerned about something, acting so... Human. \r\n\"Thanks,\" Sara said awkwardly. \r\n\r\nIt occurred to Ella then that Sara had simply gotten so used to having to do things for herself all the time, and after a while people like that learned never to ask anyone else for help. It must have pained Sara to ask her for a favour. She was so proud, so independent. Ella felt sorry for her. It would have been hard growing up like that. \r\n\r\nJust as Ella was considering saying something to Sara about it, the girl, having decided that she\'d displayed more than enough emotion in front of Ella to last a lifetime, grabbed her keys from the counter and started to dash out the door. \"Okay then. I\'m off now. Later.\" \r\n\"See you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Sara shut the front door behind her, Ella looked into the lounge room at Hunter. He was still fast asleep on the couch. One of his arms had escaped from underneath the blanket she had covered him with the day before. It was flung out sideways from the couch at a forty five degree angle. Ella thought about getting a face-washer and wiping the sweat off his forehead, then tucking his arm back under the blanket, but she really didn\'t want to risk waking him. He would need to rest up if he was going to get better. She brought her attention back to the wanted ads in the paper. \r\n\r\nThere was still the job cleaning the Sherriff\'s office up for grabs, as well as an opening for a butcher in Beattie\'s Cove and a gardener for a private estate out of town. And that was it. \r\n\r\nElla sighed. Her plans were to keep running, making her way further up north until she got to the border. If she was going to make it once she was across the border she would need more cash, though, as she would still need to lie low for a while, and if there were no suitable jobs around here for her then she would simply have to come up with another way to make money. But how? \r\n\r\nShe dejectedly flipped through the rest of the gazette. It told tales of a local forest fire where arson was suspected, a fishing boat that had gone missing from the harbour for two days only to be found again a hundred miles up the coast, and boasted about the local under 21 softball team making the state championship. When she found the \'What\'s on around town\' section she almost laughed out loud. There wasn\'t much on around town, that was for sure, apart from an upcoming fair in three weeks. The article on the fair stated that they were still looking for people to run stalls. If you had anything to sell, you were invited to apply for a stall which would only cost you thirty dollars for the day. Ella wondered...\r\n\r\nShe had always been fond of baking ever since she had been a young girl. She had liked to turn the radio up while she was baking and sing along to the songs while she kneaded dough and rolled out pastries. She hadn\'t been able to help but bop along to the music while she cut out cookies and decorated cakes. The act of measuring out exact quantities of flour, sugar and butter and mixing them in just the right way had almost made her feel like she was practising science, however at the end of it she got to eat the result, which made it better than science. As she got older there was even more to it, of course; the pleasure it gave Ella to have other people to taste the delights she had whipped up and the praise they often showered her with added to the joy. And at times she found baking was the perfect way to express care and love towards people - they always felt better when she presented them with something she had made just for them. \r\n\r\nBut her ex husband, Sam, had disliked Ella\'s love of baking. He was a fitness nut, and not only was he afraid of giving into temptation himself and gaining a few pounds from eating the brownies and cookies Ella ended up stashing around the house, he was also afraid of Ella gaining a few extra pounds herself. \r\n\r\n\"Why don\'t you take up painting or any other hobby that\'s less fattening.\"\r\n\"Because I like baking,\" she would reply. \r\n\r\nBut as usual, after badgering her non-stop for months, eventually she gave into him and once again Sam got his own way. It was always like that in their marriage... There would be something he wanted, or something he didn\'t like, and at first she would try to be reasonable about it and stand her ground, but Sam had his ways of getting what he wanted, and he didn\'t like being told \'no\'... In the end she learned that it was just better if she gave in. Sam had taught her that lesson well. And so she had stopped baking altogether.\r\n\r\nElla shivered. She didn\'t want to think about Sam right then, about what he did and didn\'t want; however, remembering his disapproval of her love of baking was all the impetus she needed to go right ahead and organise a stall for herself at the upcoming fair. She picked the phone up and dialed the number of the fair\'s stall committee. \r\n\r\nThey were more than happy to have another baked goods stall. As well as the thirty dollar stall fee, ten percent of her earnings would go to the county - the rest would be hers to keep. She rubbed her hands together excitedly. It gave her a thrill to think that she would be baking again, after not having done it for so long. It was even more of a thrill to imagine how angry Sam would be if he knew she was doing it...\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t just the baking that Ella excelled at, though; she knew that people ate with their eyes and if there was one thing she knew how to do, it was making a cupcake or a cake or a cookie look like it was worth three times what people would normally pay. And she happened to be quite the icing sugar artisan. Before Sam had convinced her to stop baking, she had made little Winnie the Pooh figurines out of the stuff to put on top of a friend\'s daughter\'s birthday cake. She beamed as she remembered the compliments she had received for those figures!\r\n\r\nA groan coming from the couch startled her out of her thoughts. She went into the lounge room to check on Hunter. When she saw how sick he was her first instinct was to tend to him, to go over to him, feel his forehead, ask if he was okay, tuck him in. But instead she stood in the doorway watching him. She had to remind herself to cool it with him. She remembered what he had said to her before they had left Beattie\'s Cove, how much it had hurt... He had told her that he didn\'t want to spend any more time with her - that they should avoid each other from then on. She decided it would really be best if she respected how he felt about her and kept her distance. That included not letting her desires get in the way, not treating him any differently than anyone else... Especially not treating him like she thought he was the most gorgeous man she\'d ever met.  \r\n\r\nHowever, as she looked over at him lying on the couch she couldn\'t stop the pity she felt for him. It was, after all, kind of her fault he had gotten sick. She needed the job, she had needed to go get the paper, and he had offered to take her there. If not for her he would have ridden with Danny, Mike and Rita and he probably wouldn\'t have gotten drenched by the rain. \r\n\r\nHis eyes opened sleepily and he stared back up at her.\r\n\"Are you feeling alright? Would you like a glass of water?\"\r\n\"That\'d be great,\" he croaked. \r\nWhen she returned with the water he had pulled the blanket down to reveal his naked chest. She tried not to be distracted by it as she walked over to him. \"Here you go,\" she said, holding the glass out to him. His eyes remained closed, however. She cleared her throat. \"Here\'s the water you wanted...\"\r\n\r\nHe made no move to take the glass from her. She sighed. Perhaps he was more ill than she had thought. She knelt down beside him, \r\ntilting the glass so that its rim touched his lips - his gorgeous, smooth, full lips. He bent his head forward slightly and took a small sip. She had to stop herself from supporting his head with other hand, placing it behind his neck. It would feel heavenly to touch him but she mustn\'t overstep the mark. When he had taken a few sips he let his head flop back onto the pillow. He looked like he was completely exhausted. Ella put the glass down on the coffee table so that it would be within his reach if he needed it later. She decided that he was alright for now, and she stood up. \r\n\r\nAs she turned to leave, though, a coughing fit suddenly took hold of him, causing him to roll over onto his side. As he did so, the blanket fell away from him completely and onto the floor, and as it did, she couldn\'t help but notice that his tight grey trunks were exposed. She bit her lip as she stared at his trunks, eyeing the package it contained, trying to get an idea of its size. As Hunter coughed even louder, she forced herself to look away from his junk and quickly picked the blanket up off the floor and covered him with it.  \r\n\r\n\"You don\'t want to get too cold,\" she said guiltily. She would have been quite content to stare at his almost naked body all day. He nodded, wiping at his eyes, which were filled with tears now from the coughing fit. \r\n\"Thanks,\" he mumbled quietly. He opened his eyes to look at her properly. He suddenly stopped wiping at his eyes, seemingly embarrassed to be so vulnerable as to need her help. He pulled the blanket up and sat up on the couch a little higher. \r\n\r\nHe was just like his sister, Ella realised, too proud to ask for help and intensely uncomfortable receiving it. \"Your sister asked me to look in on you and make sure you were okay.\" She wanted to make sure that he knew she wasn\'t violating his wishes of her remaining at arm\'s length lightly, that his sister had actually requested it from her. \r\n\r\nHunter laughed softly for a moment before his laughter turned into a sharp cough and he was forced to stop. \"Sara asked you.\" He was probably amused at how painful he must know it would have been for Sara to ask Ella for a favour. Ella smiled. \"Yes she did. And I promised I would. So do you need anything else from me while I\'m here?\"\r\n\"Why, where are you going?\" He croaked. He gave her a sideways glance from under his now half-closed lids. She looked back towards the kitchen. \"I was just checking out the paper for jobs in the kitchen.\" \r\n\"Can\'t you do that in here?\"\r\n \r\nShe had to wonder, why did he suddenly want her to stick around? Hadn\'t he made it clear the other day that he didn\'t want to spend any more time with her? She searched his face for a clue to his feelings and found nothing. His eyes were closed again, his head resting back on the pillow, one muscular arm up behind his head. \r\n\r\nIt must be the fact that he\'s sick, she decided; he must feel vulnerable. She really should stay close to him and make sure he\'s okay. How could she deny the wishes of an ill man?\r\n\r\nShe nodded at him. \"Alright.\" She went and got the paper and brought it back with her, sitting in an armchair across from the couch.  As Hunter appeared to be dozing off, she flipped through the rest of the paper to keep herself occupied. She eventually came to the classifieds... She smirked to herself. There was a love connection section in the classifieds. She amused herself for several minutes by reading through those ads. \r\n\r\nIt seemed that not many people in the area were into pina coladas and getting caught in the rain, but plenty were into cosying up by a nice, warm fireplace and going out fishing on boats and watching the sunset on the bay. She began to wonder what she might write if she were to place an ad herself. She would want someone kind and compassionate, she decided - someone entirely unlike her husband Sam. That meant someone who was willing to listen to other people\'s points of view without flying into a blind rage when those points of view didn\'t align with their own. She also wanted someone caring and strong, very attractive and with a nice body, of course... \r\n\r\nShe pictured Hunter\'s wet, glistening body as he had peeled his clothes off after getting drenched by rain the day before, beads of water dotting his naked chest, his trunks clinging to his body, those strong, muscular legs... \r\n\r\nShe closed the gazette and threw it on the floor. She had to stop herself from thinking about Hunter in that way. He had made himself perfectly clear. \r\n\r\n\"Was there anything available for you?\" His voice came as a surprise to her - she had imagined him fast asleep. In fact, he had been stealthily watching her for the last few minutes as she had been fantasising about his body, having some untoward thoughts of his own. He had seen the dreamy look in her eyes, the small smile playing at the corner of her gorgeous full, red lips... What had she been thinking about, he wondered? \r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied. \"Not a thing.\"\r\n\"There\'s always the job cleaning the Sheriff\'s Office.\"\r\n\r\nElla flinched, then realised he was watching her with those grey-green eyes of his, waiting to see how she reacted. She forced herself to relax. \"We went over that the other day, remember? It\'s not for me.\"\r\nHe narrowed his eyes. \"I see.\" He hadn\'t believed her the other day when she had first said it, and he didn\'t believe her now, either, even in his sick, weakened state. \"Something will come up.\"\r\nShe nodded. \"Actually, I was thinking of setting up my own stall at the fair.\"\r\nHunter suddenly looked very interested. His eyes opened fully and he propped himself up on one elbow to turn and look at her. \"Oh? What would you sell?\"\r\nElla wondered why he suddenly seemed so wide awake. \"Baked goods... Cookies, cakes, pastries...\"\r\n\"You can bake?\" Hunter was surprised. She seemed like such an uptight princess, the kind who always wore the latest designer clothing and wouldn\'t eat anything with carbs in it. She had the lean, petite physique of a runner or a professional dancer. He couldn\'t imagine her risking ruining it in the kitchen. \"Do you eat what you bake?\"\r\nElla scoffed. \"Of course I do! How else would I know if it was good enough? How else would I improve my technique?\"\r\n\"It\'s just that... Well....\" He let his voice trail off. His eyes roamed up and down her lithe form, lingering a little too long on her legs and torso before finally reaching her eyes again. She frowned. What was he trying to say?\r\n\"You\'re very... Athletic. I just thought...\"\r\n\"You thought I didn\'t eat?\"\r\nHunter laughed. \"Yeah, I suppose that is what I thought. I\'m sorry.\"\r\n\"You shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover,\" Ella replied. \"My physique is like this because I run a lot. Every day, usually. It\'s just that since I\'ve been here I haven\'t had a chance.\"\r\nHe nodded. \"It doesn\'t help having to look after a sick man.\"\r\nElla shrugged. \"I didn\'t mean that...\"\r\n\"No, seriously, if you want to go for a run go right ahead. I\'m feeling better already. I should be okay by tonight.\"\r\n\r\nElla studied him closely. It was true that he was no longer sweating and also that he was almost sitting up. His eyes were open and he seemed fully awake, but he was still a pale colour. \"It hasn\'t been long though.\" She remembered what his sister had told her about him thinking he was less ill than he really was. \"You still need to rest up and get fluids.\"\r\n\"Pfft,\" he replied. \"I\'m almost better. Here, I\'ll prove it to you.\" \r\n\r\nHe stood and lifted his body up off the couch but as he reached his full height the blood quickly rushed away from his head and he suddenly felt rather faint. It was as if gravity was conspiring against him, pulling his body down to the ground. He staggered on his feet as he tried to get his bearings. \r\n\r\nElla went over to him, putting her hand under his arm. \"Steady.\" She gently guided him back down onto the couch. He put his hand to his forehead. \"Just felt a bit faint, that\'s all.\" He coughed a bit. Ella pushed him backwards so that he was lying down again on his back. She grabbed his legs and put them up onto the couch, pulling the blanket back over his body. \"Do you want some more water?\'\r\n\"Yes, please,\" he said. She gave him some water. He was suddenly like a little child. She smiled to herself. \r\n\"I guess I might still be just a little bit sick,\" he admitted. He closed his eyes and leaned his head back on the pillow once more. \r\n\"Get some rest,\" Ella said gently. He nodded, drifting off to sleep. \r\n\r\nElla went back to the armchair. She had to stop herself from laughing. Sara had been right on the mark. \r\n\r\nFor the rest of the day Hunter mostly slept. Ella dissuaded him from staying awake to talk to her, despite being quite desperate for the company; she wanted him to sleep and get well more than she wanted someone to talk to. At midday she decided to make some home-style chicken soup and gave him some before having some herself. Luckily he didn\'t need her to feed it to him. She didn\'t know if she could have handled that. In any case she made sure he had plenty of water and provided him with tissues. She felt his forehead every now and then and gave him pills for his fever when it got out of control.\r\n\r\nSara and Rita got home mid-afternoon, and relieved Ella of her nursing duties. Ella took the opportunity to go for a run - talking to Hunter about it had proved to be too much of a temptation. She ran up the driveway and out to the winding mountain road, running by its side, breathing in the fresh air of the surrounding forest. Only a couple of cars passed her by. She managed to do five kilometres before returning to the house. When she got back Mike and Danny had come home. \r\n\r\nDanny was sitting in the armchair across from Hunter. \"Hey Ella, be honest - he\'s not really that sick, is he? He\'s just faking it to get sympathy from everyone, right?\"\r\n\r\nElla looked at Hunter. He certainly looked a hell of a lot better then than he had that morning. His skin tone was returning to its normal hue and he looked brighter and more awake than he had all day. \"You look almost well again.\"\r\nHunter smiled. \"Well I had a good nurse.\" Ella was pleasantly surprised... He seemed to have forgotten the day before and his decision to stay away from her at all costs. She tried not to show how pleased she was. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\"Thanks for taking care of him,\" Sara said shyly as she entered the room. \"When I first met you I thought you were a bit of a...\"\r\n\"Sara!\" Hunter admonished his sister. She laughed. \"Sorry, Ella. I just meant you seemed a bit uptight, that\'s all. But now I think you\'re pretty cool.\"\r\nElla felt truly touched, but knew that if she gushed too much Sara wouldn\'t handle it too well so she just nodded. \"It was my chicken soup. It\'s magical.\"\r\n\r\nMike came out from the kitchen and nodded to Ella. \"Still looking for work?\"\r\n\"Yeah,\" she replied. \"The paper had nothing.\"\r\n\"You\'re in luck then,\" he said. \"They\'re looking for an office administrator at the mill. Lucy\'s got meningitis. She\'s laid up in hospital. Could be there for months. They need someone ASAP. You got any experience in that area?\"\r\n\r\nElla was painfully reminded the life she had left behind in Safety Valley with Sam. The truth was that Sam had gotten her a job as an office administrator on a part time basis at the office of his friend (who also happened to be his lawyer) Fred Harvey. It hadn\'t taken Ella long to figure out why Sam had gotten his friend to hire her - it was the perfect way for him to keep tabs on her. \r\n\r\nElla nodded. \"I do actually.\"\r\n\"Well, when I go into work tomorrow, I\'ll put in a good word for you. Then if they want to interview you, one of us will take you in the next day. Sound alright?\"\r\n\"Sounds perfect, Mike, thank you so much for thinking of me.\"\r\n\"No sweat.\" Mike looked pleased with himself for being so useful. \r\n\r\nElla felt hopeful for the first time in a long time. If she could get this job and have a stall at the fair, she might just be able to make enough money to start a new life for herself far away from here.',4187,'chapter'),(9,34,'1','A woman contemplates a cup of tea.','First Draft','2016-04-29 20:40:29','2016-04-29 20:40:29','You struggle to bring the last of the heavy boxes in from the car. Using your foot to push the front door shut behind you, you drop the box down onto the hardwood floor. Before you, the lounge room of the house you will occupy for the next twelve months is littered with different sized boxes. All that is left to do now is unpack them all. \r\n\r\nYou relocated to this town for work and applied to rent this house over the phone. Quite frankly you could have chosen better; whilst it\'s roomy and fully furnished, it seems like no one has lived in this house for quite some time. This is evidenced by the fact that the curtains are heavy with dust and the pervasive odor of moth balls follows you wherever you go. \r\n\r\nAs you look out the windows you notice that the houses directly on either side of this one have been demolished leaving vacant lots in their wakes. From what you\'ve heard, this isn\'t in the best neighbourhood in the city, but you guess that\'s why the rent is so reasonable. \r\n\r\nAs the street lights flicker on they contrast sharply against the large, dark park across from the house. You decide that it will be a good place for you to take your morning jog - you certainly wouldn\'t want to go near it while it\'s dark, though. \r\n\r\nThat evening you focus on unpacking the boxes you need to put your bedroom together so you can get a decent night\'s sleep. When you\'re done filling the closet with clothes, putting toiletries in the en-suite cupboards and finally making the bed, you notice that it is directly underneath a manhole situated in the middle of the ceiling. You grab the bed and try positioning it against the left wall, then against the windows, and then against the right wall, and finally in the middle of the room - all in vain. The room is too small and no matter where you put the bed it\'s still directly underneath the manhole. You shrug, moving the bed back to its original position. You figure it\'s not a big deal; you\'ll probably forget all about it when you\'re in bed asleep anyway. \r\n\r\nHaving done all you possibly can in one day, you make yourself a cup of hot cocoa and lie in your bed in the dark, staring through the window at the dark form of the park across the street. In the dim moonlight you can just barely make out the tops of the tall trees against the midnight-coloured sky. The cup of cocoa is deliciously sweet and creamy but you\'re so tired that you can barely stay awake long enough to enjoy it. \r\n\r\nThe next sensation you’re aware of feeling is one of the strangest you’ve ever felt in your whole life. One moment you are blissfully asleep, and the next you are awake and in unbelievable pain. Your back arches as it is wracked with painful spasms that emanate from your spinal cord and spread out via your nerves to your appendages like streaks of white-hot electricity. Once the spasms have stopped, you lie still for several minutes, afraid that the pain will return. When you finally work up the nerve to move your muscles again, you can feel the remnants of former pain lingering in them, throbbing persistently like a warning. You wonder if you experienced some kind of seizure in your sleep - certainly that’s never happened to you before. \r\n\r\nYou lift your head warily, craning your neck to the side to look around. For a moment you are completely disoriented. Where the hell are you? Why is there a wall over there, a door over here? Then it comes back to you in an instant: you are in a new house. You sit up in bed, leaning over to turn on the bedside lamp. Lying there for a moment you are still bewildered by what just happened. You stare at the strange, elongated shadows cast by the boxes in the lamplight as you think about it. You smooth the bedspread out with your hands. They come into contact with a strange foamy material which appears to be scattered just about everywhere. What the hell is it? Where is it coming from? \r\n\r\nLooking around the room you can\'t find its source, until you look straight above you. It\'s at that point you notice that the manhole is open - the cover is missing - and foamy flakes of insulation are drifting down from it like a gentle snowfall. \r\n\r\nYou spring up and move backwards away from the bed, quickly meeting the wall with your back in the tiny room. You stare in disbelief at the open manhole. It was covered when you went to sleep, you know that for sure; you saw that when you tried unsuccessfully to move the bed away from it earlier. While you\'re visualising the sight of the previously covered manhole in your mind\'s eye you hear a noise - a single scuff downstairs; it sounds like the noise a shoe makes when it slips on a hardwood floor. \r\n\r\nYou freeze on the spot, holding your breath in your throat, straining your ears in case there are any further noises to be heard. Minutes pass by, and after what seems like an eternity of strained silence but is only probably a few minutes of it you realise that not only is someone else in the house with you, and not only are they downstairs right now, more than likely aware of the fact that you just heard them slip on the floor, but both the front and back doors down there are deadlocked, and you\'re effectively locked inside the house with them. \r\n\r\nYou begin to picture the downstairs part of the house with your mind\'s eye. Where would they be down there? Braced against the wall at the bottom of the stairs? Crouching under the sill of one of the windows? Quietly trying the knob of the front door? \r\n\r\nYou move with painstakingly soft movements to the bedside table and grab your mobile phone, only to realise the battery has gone dead. Damn it. The charger is still in one of the unopened boxes in your bedroom. Which box it\'s in, though, you aren\'t entirely sure of. \r\n\r\nPerhaps you should go downstairs and confront this guy. If you were to go downstairs, though, it\'d be nice to have a weapon. Your eyes scan the room for a possible weapon but the only thing they find is a tennis racquet leaning against the wall. You almost laugh aloud to yourself. What would you do, backhand the guy to death if he came near you? \r\n\r\nLeaving the racquet in the corner, you tiptoe through your open bedroom door to the top of the stairs, trying desperately not to make any noise. You can\'t see anything in the darkness of the stairwell below. You slowly begin to make your way down the stairs, trying not to make them creak. You have already made the conscious decision not to put the lights on - if you did put them on, the intruder might be able to see you, but you still probably would not be able to see them. You don\'t want that. You want to be hidden by the darkness as much as they are. \r\n\r\nIt takes you so long to get down the stairs that you start to wonder if there really is anyone else in the house after all, or if you had simply imagined hearing the scuffing noise. You haven\'t heard any noises for a while now and you can\'t see anything in the darkness ahead of you. \r\n\r\nWhen you get to the bottom of the stairs you turn to the left, knowing that the open lounge is in that direction in front of you. You move slowly and deliberately, trying to be careful, but your foot suddenly connects with an unopened box full of crap that you haven\'t unpacked yet and makes a loud, conspicuous thud. It\'s at that moment precisely that any pretense you had previously held that no one else was actually with you in the house is completely shattered. You hear another noise coming from the lounge ahead of you; this time it sounds like the shuffling of material, as though someone is standing there, not moving in their place but merely shifting their weight. \r\n\r\nYou stop moving while your eyes wear a hole in the darkness ahead of you in the direction of the noise. Then you see it, the tiniest glint of light reflecting back at you off of something the same height as a man. What is it? His eyes? His clothing? You aren\'t sure; all you know is that your intruder is standing in the middle of the lounge, several feet in front of you. \r\n\r\nYou don\'t know what to do. You are frozen in fear on the spot. Luckily for you, the intruder appears to be frozen to his spot also - perhaps he has no idea where you are. You strain your ears trying to hear something, anything, and eventually you can just make out his shallow breathing. You must be facing each other. You think about simply throwing the keys into the middle of the room and then turning around and running back upstairs and into your bedroom, barricading the door behind you. It would be the cowardly thing to do, sure, but it might bring about an end to the situation... Unless the intruder simply took possession of the keys without using them to escape and continued to stalk you in your own house. Or... You could backtrack, back to the bottom of the stairs, turn on a light and confront this guy. Without a weapon. And then be murdered by him. \r\n\r\nNo, you don\'t want to do either of those things. What you really want to do is try to quickly use your keys in one of the deadlocked doors in order to escape.\r\n\r\nYou start backing up towards the bottom of the staircase, hoping the intruder can\'t hear you but knowing that he probably can. With your hands stretched out behind you, you fumble blindly for the railing of the staircase. Finding it, you keep backing up, ignoring the stairs and heading instead in the direction of the deadlocked back door. Finally you bump your back into it with a soft thud; you are still facing in the direction of the intruder, but thankfully you haven\'t sensed him moving. By your estimation he would have to be about ten feet away from you now. That should give you, what? Five seconds? \r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath, you find the lock with your left hand fumbling behind your back. In your right hand are the keys. You quickly turn around and try the first key in the lock. It doesn\'t turn. Behind you you can hear him shifting his weight again, preparing to move towards you. You try the second key. It doesn\'t work either. You hear his footsteps slowly but firmly making their way towards you. Trembling and almost dropping the keys in the process you try a third one. Behind you the guy stumbles into the coffee table, swearing softly under his breath. \r\n\r\nFinally, thankfully, the door swings mercifully open and you run outside, down the back porch stairs and around the house to the front yard, not daring to look behind you. You think briefly about getting in the car and driving away; unfortunately the car keys are on a separate keyring from the house keys and still back in the house somewhere. \r\n\r\nYou look around at the almost deserted street; you have one neighbour a few empty lots away to the right whose lights are on. They shine out to you, welcoming you like a homing beacon. Should you run over there and try the door? There is also the park across the street which seductively offers its cover of darkness to you. No way. You decide to try your neighbour\'s house. \r\n\r\nAs you pound on the door to the neighbour\'s house no one answers but the front door swings open revealing a well-lit hall. \r\n\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone home? Please, I need help!\" \r\n\r\nNo one answers your call. You shut the door behind you and look around for a person or a phone. No phone in the living room to the left; no owner that you can see, either, despite all the lights being on. You quickly make your way further into the hall and try the first door on the right. It\'s a bathroom. On to the second door. A small bedroom, no phone. Further on down - dining room on the left, closet on the right. Still no people in this house. Finally, though, you find a useful room through another door on the left. It\'s a study. \r\n\r\nThere\'s a large desk with a seat behind it facing the doorway. On the desk is a computer and a phone. You walk around to sit behind the desk and pick up the cordless phone from its dock, dialing emergency. As you do this you accidentally move the mouse with your arm and the computer monitor blinks to life. As the screen lights up you gasp at what you see: a top-down view of your disheveled bed. \r\n\r\nYour breath catches in your throat as you shoot up out of the chair and into the hall. You begin to move towards the front door but as you do this you see the shadow of a figure advancing towards you through its mosaic glass paneling. Your heart skips a beat. You back up, turning around to try the back door knob, the phone slipping out of your sweaty hands as you do so and cluttering clumsily to the floor. The door is locked. You pick the phone up again but as you do so you notice that the red light has been replaced with a green one... That probably means that the emergency call didn\'t connect. \r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps on the front porch causes an electric jolt to surge your body into action once more. You dart speedily yet softly up the stairs. Up there you make out a small bathroom, a main bedroom, a spare bedroom and some closets. At the end of the upstairs hall is a normal sized window.\r\n\r\nYou can hear your pursuer downstairs opening the front door and you make a note to yourself be extra quiet. You look around frantically trying to decide on the most decent hiding spot... Your eyes keep being drawn to two places in particular: the window at the end of the hall which looks big enough for you to fit through and the spare bedroom. The spare bedroom has a large double bed you could hide under. You can hear him walking around downstairs, checking each room in turn. It won\'t take long for him to realise you aren\'t downstairs.\r\n\r\nYou run over to the window and with relief notice that there is a section of roof jutting out below the window at a very small, forgiving angle - it is the top of the front porch. You put the phone in the band of your pyjamas and gingerly step out onto it. You shut the window quietly behind you and carefully tiptoe to the left edge of the roof and around the corner, out of sight of the hall window. \r\n\r\nThe small lower roofing extends around the corner, past the master bedroom window. He could easily come out and get you from here. You look out over the edge of the roof you now stand on. It seems like a large drop from this height. Do you want to risk breaking your legs? Not yet. There might yet be another choice. \r\n\r\nComing out from the master bedroom wall is the back of one of those large air conditioning units. It is big enough for you to climb on and then reach the guttering of the higher second story roofing. Up on that higher angled roofing you notice that an attic window juts out; the top of that attic window is flat and comes out from the main roof a bit, so if you could just manage to scramble up there you\'d be in a safer position - and perhaps you would be able to see him coming, if he were to come after you up here. \r\n\r\nIt takes you a few minutes but you manage to get up there despite the fickle tiling and treacherous incline. When you are finally up there you remember the phone in the waist of your pants... If you wanted to, you could try calling emergency again. Or you just could wait to see if your pursuer even thinks to search for you out on the roof.\r\n\r\nYou pull the phone out from the waist of your pants to dial emergency again, patiently, desperately waiting, your eyes staring apprehensively at the roof below you the whole time. The phone clicks; it has connected. \r\n\r\n\"Hello? Hello?\" \r\n\r\nYour voice sounds strange to you; very loud, and altogether too desperate. There is no nasally emergency call centre greeting for you on the other end of that line. You can hear static though... A never-ending stream of menacing static. You tremble as you realise he must have the other of a pair of wireless phones. \r\n\r\nYou listen to the static, swallowing dryly, trying not to make any noise that might give away where you are. He must be waiting for you to make some noise while he continues searching for you inside the house. You can just make out the sounds of him opening and closing doors, his breathing getting louder and louder the more frustrated he becomes from not being able to find you. You hear him thumping down the stairs, checking the first floor again, in the pantry, behind furniture. \r\n\r\nYou almost laugh. He can\'t find you. Your mirth is short lived, however, once you realise that he probably would have thought you\'d gotten away, if you hadn\'t used the damn phone... \r\n\r\nYou still have it pressed firmly to your ear. You jump with surprise as a voice suddenly rasps at you, \"I know where you are.\" Then the line goes completely dead. \r\n\r\nYou try to dial emergency again, but when you hit the number buttons the phone isn\'t reacting at all. He must have cut the line. You frustratedly throw the phone away from you and watch as it bounces on the grass.\r\n\r\nYou hear the master bedroom window sliding open, see his head sticking out, searching for you. It doesn\'t take him long to spot you - that\'s when you feel the icy hand of fear as it wraps itself firmly around you, paralysing you. \r\n\r\nHe steps out onto the roof and heads towards the air conditioning unit. You scramble backwards, away from his line of sight, stumbling on the treacherous roofing. You decide to make your way across to the other side of the house where you can see the garage roof. It looks much flatter and lower to the ground, and if you can just reach it you might just be able to make it safely down from there. \r\n\r\nAs you reach the part of the roofing where the north and south sides meet to make an apex you can afford to relax for a second, so you turn around to see how close your pursuer is. He is still coming towards you at a decent pace but you notice that his footing is even more tenuous than yours was as he tries to make his way up the steep south side of the roof. In fact, if you stay where you are - above him on the roof - you might be able to catch him off-balance. He has the advantage of greater strength, but if you managed to push him before he realised what you were doing you could probably push him right off the roof.',3354,'content'),(15,30,'','','Branching Out','2016-04-30 22:22:47','2016-04-30 22:22:47','​When you want to make big changes to your code, but are afraid of colossally fucking up, you back it up in its entirety so you are free to make whatever radical changes you want, safe in the knowledge that you can always go back to what you had before which was adequate, much like a child tottering a few feet away from mummy to explore the world in its own.',72,'entry'),(16,30,'','','Guinea Pig','2016-04-29 20:56:50','2016-04-29 20:56:50','​Here it is...

A lot of women could be in the position of thinking that they want a long term, stable relationship with a man, when in actual fact, deep down inside, they want nothing of the sort. \r\n\r\nWhat would a person in this position do, a person with conflicting goals? They would probably make every outward appearance of attempting to satisfy the socially acceptable goal whilst also self sabotaging. They could do this by pushing men away - and in turn this can be done in a number of various ways. A woman could set up a bunch of conditions within the courtship ritual that simply could never be met. In this way she is by all appearances creating ways for the suitor to win her over - yet he can never quite hit the mark. \r\n\r\nAnother way for her to successfully self sabotage would be to set up vague or ambiguous conditions that, while technically being met by the suitor, always fail to hit the mark due to being badly or erroneously determined. And thus the suitor, realising that he hasn\'t met the conditions, asks what he did wrong, and then attempts once again to fill the requirements only to fail yet again due to even more erroneously determined conditions and in the end comes to the conclusion that he can\'t win and so decides to give up, which gives the woman what she secretly wants yet outwardly leaves her with an unmet goal. In this way she is able to take on the role of the helpless victim: I set out to attain something and failed due to my needs consistently not being met. Even though deep down she knows she didn\'t really give anyone a chance to properly meet them. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately while temporarily satisfying for her the woman is left unable to move forward because she can\'t face the truth that she doesn\'t actually want this goal to be met so she is doomed to repeat the cycle again and again and again. Instinctively the suitor senses that the woman doesn\'t really want to be won over and the easiest way for him to exit is to leave without a trace because his pride is hurt and if he confronts the situation only to find a new set of requirements that he can\'t possibly meet he finds him self stuck in a cycle also where he can\'t fulfil the requirements either and so it\'s easier for him to just leave and give her what she wants which is to be the victim.',444,'entry'),(43,30,NULL,NULL,'That Familiar Feeling','2016-04-08 20:56:50','2016-04-08 20:56:50','​Because feeling that feeling of being with someone that should love you and should care about you but just doesn\'t for whatever reason was all too familiar to her.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly the same relationship she had with her mother, who by all accounts, had never really wanted children in the first place, and saw them as nothing more than a means to an end unfortunately.',66,'entry'),(44,30,NULL,NULL,'Sex','2016-04-07 20:56:50','2016-04-07 20:56:50','​Men immediately turn into jerks once you have sex with them.

Her intuition was screaming at her to run away from him as fast as she could. There was something about him that was bad, something terribly wrong. But she couldn\'t quite pinpoint exactly what it was.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning she had felt that something was off - she couldn\'t shake the feeling that he just didn\'t like her all that much. The more she spent time with him, the more the feeling persisted, and in the end it never left her with a moment\'s peace. It was like a stubborn cough that tickled at the throat throughout the day at random intervals, always making its presence known and never able to be relieved. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning she questioned him about it - asked him - did he like her? And he would reassure her, and tell her yes, he did, but his actions simply never matched his words and that is why she never believed it. In the end he wouldn\'t bother reassuring her, instead he would simply fly into a rage and start attacking her.\r\n\r\nThey had met at a cafe in St Kilda to have coffee. She had noticed that he had quickly grown bored with her as soon as she began speaking on a topic of her own choosing. He tended to gaze off into the distance until she had finished, changing the topic to something completely different. It left her with the impression that he was wholly uninterested in what she had just said. When he wasn\'t doing that he simply remained silent. She found the silence worse than the change of topic. It was a long, invalidating kind of silence, the kind that felt strangely familiar - in fact, it felt so famililar because her mother had a tendency towards the same kinds of silences. \r\n\r\nWhen she spoke to her mother on the phone or even in person, she got the distinct feeling that she was being burdonsome to her, that her mother viewed her as something to be endured in order to obtain some unknown end result rather than something to be enjoyed. And this man was making her feel the exact same way. \r\n\r\nSadly, at the time, she had chalked it up to him having nerves. This was partly due to the fact that he had spoken about his anxiety at making people feel \'awkward\'. He had said that he was too \'stuck inside his own head\'. Maybe, maybe not...\r\n\r\nBut signs of his disinterest in her as a person only continued from that point forward. On their second date he spent a great deal of time telling her about the other women in their shared social circles that he had asked out or was currently talking to. He also stiffed her on dinner in the most obnoxious way - he had set the date for six, and they were going to see a movie - only at the very last minute he had messaged her to say that he intended on getting there half an hour early to stuff a burger down his throat. She was, of course, welcome to join him if she liked. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, rather than answering him politely with, \"Oh, I thought we were going to have dinner together?\" Which would have been the appropriate thing to do, she swallowed her disappointment and replied with, \"Okay I\'ll see you there.\" Then, five minutes before he arrived she suddenly felt her true feelings and got angry at him. She didn\'t want to show him this anger though so instead she sent a message saying, \"I\'ll leave you to eat dinner. I\'ve changed my mind about the movie.\" Unfortunately he ran into her as she was making her exit and so she couldn\'t avoid the situation. \r\n\r\nThings just went from bad to worse from then on. They went to his apartment where he told her that he had recently witnessed an eighty year old woman being taken out of her house on a stretcher. He didn\'t want to die that way - alone. Having abandoned the movie altogether they ended up almost sleeping together. They were kissing and touching, and it got quite heated; eventually he told her that he got the feeling that she just wanted to be fucked. She told him she wanted them to get to know each other. He was poised above her and she could see the desire in his eyes. She kept staring back at him, waiting to see what he would do. She wasn\'t going to give him the green light to go ahead. Already she was beginning to dislike him. Still, she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he was just stupid and that\'s why he talked about other women he wanted in front of her. Maybe his sudden disinterest whenever she spoke was just social anxiety. Maybe he didn\'t just decide to start something with her from a fear of dying alone. Maybe this excuse, maybe that excuse. \r\n\r\nThe reality was that she was sick of being single, sick of being alone, and anything at that point would have been better. Even being with an emotional abuser. \r\n\r\nLooking back at that moment she wished that she had just slept with him then and that he had promptly lost interest in her afterwards. It would have been less painful than the pain she had come to endure from him from that point on. \r\n\r\nWhen they next saw each other they went to a cafe in his suburb on his lunchbreak - she drove there - even though she had an appointment soon afterwards to get to, and it seemed to her that she was making most of the effort for this guy, and hey, if he actually liked her, shouldn\'t he be trying to see her and not the other way around - and then they walked to the cafe which was way out of her price range. He told her that his friends had warned him against her when he had told them that she didn\'t currently have a job. She felt quite put down by that. He of course said he didn\'t care at all. However she distinctly felt that it was as if he was trying to let her know that she wasn\'t quite good enough for him. \r\n\r\nHe wanted to eat in front of her. She explained that the place was simply out of her price range - she couldn\'t afford to spend twenty dollars on bacon and eggs. In fact, she rarely spent money on restuarnt or cafe food. It wasn\'t in her nature to do so. They passed a bakery on the way back to his apartment. She made a mistake then. She supposed she was still smarting about the put down at her not having a job and him so magnanimously not caring about it. She confided to him that her ex hadn\'t exactly been Brad Pitt, but she had loved him anyway; in essence, that looks weren\'t the most important thing for her. It was more about how someone treated her than how good he looked. \r\n\r\nIronically he never really did treat her that well anyway. \r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, after they had slept together, he found reasons to bring up Justin Bieber; in particular, a song which had the lyrics, \"If you like the way you look so much then baby you should go and love yourself.\" She even heard him singing it in her presence on more than one occasion. Once he even wanted to play it. She declined. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, while with him, she was responsible for 100% of her orgasms.\r\n\r\nHe often accused her of holding onto resentments. She found that quite amusing. He was hands-down the most resentful person she had ever met. \r\n\r\nHe bought her dinner at Grilld, which was great - but then made a joke about how easy she was as all it took to get her into bed was to buy her a cheeseburger.\r\n\r\nOnce they had slept together the criticisms came thick and fast. Not only that, he expected her to wait on him, to cook for him while he lazed around on the couch or played video games, like she was his mother or something. He even took calls in her presence because talking to her, having a conversation with her and engaging with her clearly was the last thing he wanted to do. \r\n\r\nUnless he was criticising her or lecturing her. Then he was suddenly interested in talking - well, talking at her, not really to her. But if she began to talk about something she liked, suddenly he would want to practice mindfulness or meditate. In other words, anything other than have a conversation with her. \r\n\r\nShe started trying to point out to him that he just didn\'t like her that much. For some strange reason he wouldn\'t admit to it. \r\n\r\nHe told her that he didn\'t want to introduce her to his parents or his grandparents or in fact anyone in his family. That hurt her feelings. She told him that she didn\'t want to meet them anyway but was confused as to why he would say that to her in the first place. After all, they had only known each other two weeks, if that. It was too early to meet each others family. \r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that he enjoyed putting her down, any chance he got, even if nonsensically.  \r\n\r\nHe started to project his ex girlfriend\'s personality onto her. When she tried to get him to see that he just didn\'t like her all that much he claimed that she was \'pushing him away\' and that \'he wouldn\'t abandon her\'. While this was flattering for her she didn\'t really find it all that relevant but stayed with him anyway in the hopes that one day he would stop being so mean to her. That never happened. \r\n\r\nIf she ever tried to point out how mean he was being to her he would tell her she was being:\r\nDramatic\r\nToo sensitive\r\nTaking things too personally\r\n\r\nOne day she touched his chest as she was talking to him - he went into a frenzy saying that he didn\'t like to be hit or poked. She apologised and endeavoured not to do it again. Whenever he crossed her boundaries, though, she was expected just to put up with it. He asked to put a soiled condom in her car. She said no. He kept trying to put it in there anwyay. Afterwards he acted like she was the unreasonable one despite the fact that he clearly had double standards about boundaries being crossed. \r\n\r\nHe accused her of wanting to cheat on him with a man from his al anon group, a man she had never met. He asked her if she had been drinking one day. She didn\'t drink. He often forgot conversations they had had - obviously she wasn\'t that important to him; due to his lack of interest in talking to her, their conversations were few and far between, so she would think that he would remember the two or three they had actually had. He didn\'t though. Obviously she didn\'t even factor on his radar at all. \r\n\r\nOnce he even made her cry - he was that mean to her - and when he saw it he told her that sometimes when someone shows you kindness after not having known it, it causes tears. This made her cry even harder. She wanted so badly to tell him that sometimes you cry because the man you like doesn\'t like you at all; he comes into your house, criticises it and everything about you, then has sex with you and wants to leave directly afterwards. And it hurts. It also hurts when he dismisses everything you feel as being \'dramatic\' and doesn\'t take your concerns seriously. But he wouldn\'t have heard it. \r\n\r\nOnce they had had sex and she had given him head during the foreplay, and then he had wanted to have sex again and had tried to make her give him oral sex again and she had declined, he accused her of being selfish. \r\n\r\nHe even picked on her anatomy. \r\n\r\nHe thought he knew more than a psychiatrist. He denied she had a mental illness that she had formally been diagnosed with - imagine that, she didn\'t even have the right to have a mental illness in his eyes. In his eyes, she was simply character flawed. Unbelievable. \r\n\r\nWhen she brought up to him again that the relationship wasn\'t really that great, and that after every time she saw him she felt like crap because he was so incredibly mean to her, he said he didn\'t want to hurt her by ending it. HAHAHA! He said it with a straight face. She assured him that it certainly wouldn\'t hurt her. He deduced that she was cold and heartless. \r\n\r\nWhat he didn\'t understand is that she couldn\'t possibly love someone that was so mean to her. So uninterested in her. So resentful and selfish. \r\n\r\nShe realised she could walk out onto the main street right near his apartment, right then, and within an hour (maybe even less) she could probably find a man her age, single, attractive and successful who was willing to treat her better than he had been treating her. With respect. With dignity. With admiration. With friendship. With compassion. \r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she felt terribly sorry for him, because obviously he has never known a truly loving, supportive relationship and how good it feels to be in one, because if he had, he wouldn\'t settle for anything less. \r\n\r\nShe had to write this in this way because he never allowed her to defend herself against him. He would raise his voice, cut her off, dismiss her opinion, tell her she was being dramatic, call her names, etc. So this was literally THE ONLY WAY she could have her say. \r\n\r\nHe was an emotional abuser. She was prone to outbursts of rage, she was paranoid at times and suffered from anxiety, but in no way was she deserving of the way he treated her. Not at all. \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nNow that she\'s thought about it for a while, several new things come to light. \r\n\r\n1. Demanding things from men doesn\'t work - only if they\'re really weak men. If they are more dominant types they just get fed up, angry, or think you\'re high maintenance and leave. \r\n2. Nagging isn\'t great either; it\'s slightly better than demanding but again a lot of men don\'t respond to it. \r\n3. She grew up in a home with a mother whose only way of asking for things was to demand them. She had no other mode of operation. \r\n\r\nOther people use different tactics to get what they wantâ ¦\r\n - they use guilt \r\n - reverse psychology \r\n - they use compassion\r\n - they use love / affection etc <-- she could probably do this one\r\n - they ask nicely \r\n - they act weak and helpless \r\n - they act pouty and childlike \r\n\r\nHowever, even if she were to change the way she asks for things, he is still going to call her \'selfish\' when she doesn\'t want to give him a headjob, and still going to want to be selfish and sit around playing video games and ignoring her / not talking to her / not paying attention to her when she\'s there unless it\'s for sex; in other words, if she gives an inch he\'ll take a mile. \r\n\r\nShe really just doesn\'t know how to get what she wants from men. Expecting them to just give it to her is naive, isn\'t it? How many men are going to be the perfect partner, really? So it stands to reason that there has to be a way to get stuff out of them. \r\n\r\nBut she still think this one obviously hates her. And she thinks he\'s in abuse mode now and that\'s not going to change because abusers don\'t get less abusive, do they? They either keep up a steady effort or get more abusive. \r\n\r\nThe other thing is how do you maintain boundaries with people who overstep them and then don\'t acknowledge that they\'ve overstepped them? \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nI am an abuser\'s dream.\r\n\r\nNot only do I feel right at home placating an angry, abusive person, but I give them the perfect justification for being angry in the first place.\r\n\r\nBecause my mother only knew of two ways to get what she wanted - demanding it or throwing an angry tantrum like a three year old, I am prone to demanding what I want and throwing angry tantrums when I don\'t get it. Abusers would love this - when I demand, they withhold. When they withhold, I go into tantrum mode. When I go into tantrum mode, the abuser now has the perfect justication for being abusive - AND - added bonus for them - I am programmed to respond perfectly to their angry abuse. \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nThe viciousness in himâ ¦ A lot of men wouldn\'t react that way. If someone was asking something from them that they didn\'t want to give, they wouldn\'t get vicious. A lot of men would simply walk away, fade out. A lot of men would explain themselves calmly and logically, analysing the situation and where things were going wrong. They wouldn\'t beome vicious, turning on a dime. They wouldn\'t suddenly go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. \r\n\r\nImagine a guy like that with a child. He would be like that angry old grandpa at the park when the granddaughter was crying. \"Why are you ruining this day for us? Stop being so selfish.\" What a horrible man. What damage he is inflicting upon an innocent child. What a travesty. \r\n\r\nIt\'s not a quality I want in a partner, that\'s for sure. I couldn\'t imagine spending too much time with someone like that. Especially when they can\'t even pay me the courtesy of listening to me while I speak. Especially when they see fit to shut me down all the time and won\'t allow me to have opinions or thoughts or feelings about things. They wouldn\'t allow me to be a person. \r\n\r\nI would basically just be a sex and affection vending machine for them. Maybe that\'s what they want. All they have to do is push the right buttons and insert the right amount of coins and they can get what they want conveniently dispensed. When the machine starts rambling on (talking about something its interested in) they can just walk away and ignore it. When the machine expresses and opinion, thought or feeling that they don\'t like, just shut it down. Come back later when you need something again and turn it on again, insert coins, push buttons. Rinse and repeat. Too easy. \r\n\r\nNow that I ruminate on it some more, the question arises: do men get to just ask for what they want in relationships? And if so, are women more than willing to give it? And if so, why aren\'t women afforded the same right? Why do men fly into a perilous rage when women dare to ask for something they want?',3198,'entry'),(52,36,'2','Ella is frustrated - she thinks she can\'t be what a man wants her to be.','Pretending to be something else and then having it come undone','2016-03-28 20:56:50','2016-03-28 20:56:50','She was tired. \r\n\r\nTired of having to pretend to be the woman men wanted. The strong, sophisticated, independent career woman who was always practical, the woman who always kept her emotions in check because she wasn\'t one of those high maintenance types, those princesses who needed constant reassurance and babying. She was supposed to be cool, into all the things that modern women were supposed to enjoy - manly tv shows and pursuits, superheroes, sports, politics, etc, etc. She was supposed to be down to earth, easy to talk to, never letting her emotions get the better of her; she was supposed to always be witty, always able to see the funny side of things, in a perpetual state of relaxation. She was supposed to always pay her own way and above all, she was supposed to be aggressively sexual… \r\n\r\nMore than anything, she wanted to show her real self to men from the get-go - the fact that she was very emotional (she saw it as an asset - she could feel compassion for others). She was also very needy - she had endured a very difficult childhood and as a result in relationships she needed constant reassurance in order to feel safe. Deep down she felt that she deserved someone who understood that and would just provide it for her no questions asked, rather than the usual type she dated who was so begrudging about it, like she was asking for something that was too expensive. She could be whiny at times when she didn\'t get her own way, and terribly unsophisticated - getting around in sweat pants with no make up on, leaving the toilet door open, not doing the dishes, etc, but she was only human, and contrary to common custom she actually didn\'t enjoy cleaning - she had much better things to do with her time. She enjoyed chick flicks and ridiculously over the top soap operas and romance novels - and didn\'t want to have to apologise for it. She also liked girly pop music and thought most male team sports were barbaric and violent. \r\nShe was completely impractical. She was a dreamer and always had to do things the hard way. She was also impulsive, selfish, and childish. \r\n\r\nBut men didn\'t seem to like these things about her. As soon as she started to show them these things, to show them her real self, they would bail. She\'d experienced it countless times.\r\n \r\nThe truth was that they wanted the woman who could go to work and make the big bucks, but also be the helpless, frail yet hot little feminine kitten that spent forty hours a week at the gym, the impeccably dressed and manicured vegan that cleaned the house obsessively because she couldn\'t handle anything being out of place. They wanted someone who was into the same violent TV shows and sports they were into. They wanted a woman who would show them that she wanted sex as much as they did, but when in bed, would be a total pushover, giving them the foreplay they wanted without needing to receive any for herself from them. They wanted a woman - but one who wasn\'t emotional, one who was practical, one who was solution-focused. Someone who didn\'t feel every little feeling, someone who bottled everything up like they did and relied on pure logic to make decisions. \r\n\r\nThey basically wanted a woman who was a man. A creature who adored and needed men and relationships, but who let men do their own thing; a woman who wouldn\'t sink her hooks into them, a woman who didn\'t need to know how they felt about her or where she stood. A woman who was too independent and \'busy living her own life\'. \r\n\r\nBut she simply wasn\'t like that. She always wanted to know where she stood with men. She wanted commitment. She wasn\'t footloose and fancy free - she wanted to know that things were definitely going somewhere - otherwise, what was the bloody point? For men to expect her not to want those things… Well, it seemed terribly unfair. They were essentially telling her not to be herself. The worst part about it was that other women were telling her not to be herself as well, as were all the self help books that lined her shelves. \"Don\'t be yourself,\" they warned, \"you\'ll scare him away. Pretend to be cool. Pretend to be aloof and unemotional. Pretend to be busy. That\'ll win him over, fool him into thinking you\'re actually a man with a vagina and a set of breasts.\" \r\n\r\nAnd so she pretended. And always, inevitably, the facade unraveled, bit by bit, exposing more and more of her real and undesirable personality, like a favourite old t-shirt showing through the bare skin underneath, becoming more and more threadbare with every turn in the washing machine. \r\n\r\nThe last relationship had been the worst. She had actually grown very adept at fooling men at that point - however, she absolutely hated herself for it - she felt like a complete fake, pretending that she wasn\'t lonely and depressed, pretending that she was busy and fulfilled in her life. Pretending that she wasn\'t all needy and broken inside. It was horrible. And yet it worked superbly. At first.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life a man had given her roses. He\'d written her a poem, taken her out to dinner, to a movie, to other places, too - he\'d cooked her dinner, introduced her to his mother and his friends, promised her the moon. And she had been so unbelievably happy. \r\n\r\nBut then the false persona had begun to unravel. She could see in his eyes, after some time; could see that he simply wasn\'t as impressed with her as he originally had been. It probably wasn\'t a conscious decision on his part… And she supposed, if he was a meaner type of person, he might feel duped rather than simply disappointed. He might become vicious and vindictive, thinking her playing some kind of game with him, pretending to be someone and then turning into someone else. But instead they simply grew apart over time. He withdrew back into his own world, and the more he withdrew, the worse she felt. She kept trying desperately to hold onto that original feeling, that exultation at adoring someone and being adored in return so completely, at being so wonderfully happy… \r\n\r\nBut she couldn\'t. He wasn\'t there anymore. He was there physically, but he wasn\'t really present. He was just going through the motions. \r\n\r\nShe had told him in the beginning that the worst feeling in the world was being with someone that you knew didn\'t love you anymore. The way they acted - the way they never looked at you anymore, never really saw you. The way they never seemed to listen to you anymore, like everything you said was already tired and stale before it even came out of your mouth. And she had told him - no, made him promise, even - leave me, she had said. Leave me before that happens. Promise.  \r\n\r\nHe had made the promise but he hadn\'t left. He\'d stayed, like most men in that situation do, perhaps quietly hoping that his former love would once again emerge to replace the pale copy that now inhabited her body. She had been angry that he had done that. She had told him that she wouldn\'t have the strength to leave should the situation arise, that it would have to be him to be the one to end it, and he had promised. Yet here he was, a living ghost, expecting her to continue on with the relationship as though nothing was wrong. He expected her to do all the work - to kiss him and hug him and love him and talk to him knowing full well that HE WASN\'T THERE. She was dealing with nothing more than a mannequin, a hologram. And still he expected her to continue on. \r\n\r\nShe had done it, finally, she had found the strength to leave. And she had made damn sure it was dramatic and painful so that he would feel it, remember it. Because damn him for doing that to her. Damn him for hurting her so badly.  \r\n\r\nThat had been four years ago. She had dated since then, but it was always with a certain amount of trepidation.',1406,'chapter'),(54,36,'3','Ella meets the man of her dreams when her train is late one morning.','Meet Cute','2016-03-29 20:56:50','2016-03-29 20:56:50','She stomped her feet and wrapped her coat around her even tighter as she braved the cold morning winds while she waited for the 8.15 train. Her gaze was drawn to the roads that ran parallel to the railway, towards the self driving cars that neatly adorned them. As always, the traffic danced gracefully along in perfect harmony, the movements of the cars meticulously choreographed by a satellite network that orbited far above and cast its omniscient eye over everything. \r\n\r\nShe would dearly love to be one of the lucky ones, one of those who either could afford or, for some special reason were afforded a permit that allowed them access to the cars for their work commutes. Everyone was allowed to use their self driving cars during leisure times but during the work day the government hadn\'t wanted people to abandon the public transport system they had spent decades perfecting, so most people had to continue to suffer a long and ever increasingly crowded commute to work. If they really wanted to they of course had the option to buy the workday permit, but the cost of such a permit was so defiantly prohibitive that only the very wealthy ever bought them.\r\n\r\nThe trains were for this reason incredibly crowded. Sometimes there were too many people waiting for a train at once and she found herself waiting for the next one because she couldn\'t, or rather, wouldn\'t bother trying to fit in her own. She preferred the 8.23, in fact, to the 8.15 train, but her experience with the 8.23 had been that too many other people shared the preference and so she took the earlier train to save herself the hassle of vying for a position on the later train. \r\n\r\nOn this particularly cold and blustering morning the 8.15 just happened to be running late, which meant that the people waiting for the 8.23 had started to arrive. By 8.20 she surmised that by the time her 8.15 train did actually arrive the 8.23 train people would want to board it and thus they would probably push out most of the 8.15 people. The 8.15 people began to edge their way closer and closer towards the yellow lines while the 8.23 people just behind them began to clamber in as well, not wanting to forfeit their right to board the train anymore than the 8.15 people. By 8.25, the 8.31 people had started to arrive also. The platform swelled with them all, the 8.15, 8.23 and 8.31 people, a swarm of angry commuters buzzing like bothered hornets. \r\n\r\nShe sighed. People had already begun to turn. They were elbowing her and stepping on her feet. In situations like this she found it best just to bow out, to surrender to the competition and accept her fate: she was going to be late. It wasnt her fault - the trains were running late, not her. People at work would just have to understand. This was probably one of the reasons why she wasn\'t more successful at work. \r\n\r\nIn any case, she made her way back through the swarm to the platform gates. She scanned her card and tried to go through the gate at the same time as another commuter who was also trying to exit. They ended up almost sandwiched together between the gates. As they both pulled back from the gate, she looked up to see her fellow escapee; a tall man with dark rimmed glasses, kind green eyes and short brown hair. He had a calm, nice kind of face. She had no idea who had scanned their card first. \r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" she mumbled at the exact same time as he mumbled, \"Sorry! Didnt see you there.\"\r\nShe smiled at him. \"I was in such a hurry to get away from the angry mob.\" \r\n\"Me too,\" he replied. \"Not worth potentially losing an eye for a seat on the train, is it? I\'d rather just be late.\"\r\n\"Exactly.\" \r\nHe gestured for her to go through the gates before him. \"Thanks.\" \r\n\r\nOne by one they scanned again and went through the gate. Once on the other side she contemplated the nearby cafe. She probably had time for a coffee while she waited for this situation to sort itself out. He followed her gaze. \"Thinking of waiting it out in there?\"\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"Their coffee is pretty decent.\"\r\nHe smiled at her shyly. \"Would you mind if I joined you?\"\r\nShe laughed nervously. \"Not at all. I\'d appreciate the company.\" \r\n\r\nShe thought he was very cute. Kind of shy and self conscious, unlike the men she had met recently who were all false bravado and arrogance  (though one could be forgiven for wondering where their confidence came from). This man, however, should have all their confidence and more, but somehow miraculously didn\'t.\r\n\r\nThey ordered and sat at the window, keeping an eye on the crowded platform. For a moment the gravity of the situation hit them - they were two strangers, opposite genders, at a public place not having properly met yet. It almost felt like a date except for the fact that it was 8.34 in the morning. \r\n\r\nFinally he broke the silence. \"By the way, my name is Peter.\"\r\n\"I\'m Ella,\" she replied. They clumsily shook hands over the table. \r\n\"It\'s nice to meet you, Ella.\" His eyes crinkled when he smiled - such a nice, friendly face. No visible signs of deception in it, just genuine joy at being there with her. \r\n\"Likewise.\"\r\n\"So, what do you do for a crust?\"\r\n\"I\'m a project manager at an IT company. And you?\"\r\nHe replied, \"Wonderful,\" and seemed genuinely impressed. For once she didn\'t feel patronised after answering that question. \"I\'m an editor for a wildly unpopular literary journal.\" \r\nShe laughed. \"What\'s it called? Maybe I\'ve heard of it.\" She thought about how good it would be if she did in fact know the publication, even though the chances were that she probably in all likelihood didn\'t. \r\n\"It\'s called Defiant Whimsy.\" He smiled crookedly as he watched her reaction to the name. \"It\'s a rather odd title, I know.\"\r\n\"You were right, I haven\'t heard of it,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"Although it sounds delightful. I\'ll buy a copy tonight.\"\r\nHe laughed. \"Good luck finding one!\"\r\n\"Oh, will I have trouble finding it?\"\r\nHe thought about it for a moment. \"Perhaps I should just send you a copy, it might be easier.\"\r\nShe blushed. \"Oh, only if it\'s not too much trouble, of course!\"\r\nHe looked so pleased that she wanted to read it; he was positively beaming. \"Not at all Ella! I hope you don\'t mind giving me your address, though - I am a stranger, after all!\"\r\nThen it was her turn to think about it for a moment. He seemed so nice, so genuine. She really didn\'t have a problem giving him her address (though she should have had a problem with it. Why were women so naive and trusting?). However, he said, \"I know, give me your work address, and I\'ll have it sent there! That way it\'s not at all creepy.\"\r\nShe laughed. \"Okay.\" He took her details down, including her number. \"Splendid. You shall have a copy in no time. Then you can see for yourself why the publication is as unpopular as it is.\"\r\n\"I\"m sure it\'s not,\" she replied, laughing some more, marvelling at just how humble he was. It truly was refreshing. \r\n\"Tell me, have you managed a project that I might know about?\"\r\nShe nodded. \"The software that runs the Magnuson bilboards, in fact.\" \r\nShe pointed through the window at the gap between the gate to the train platform. \"They use them on all the train platforms and in some shopping centres.\"\r\n\"Wow,\" he said. \"Was that a complicated project?\"\r\n\r\nShe contemplated his question for a moment. It had been rather complicated project, in fact. Electronics had come a long way in the last few decades - all electronics those days was considered \'smart eletronics\'. This meant that the bilboards could calculate exactly who was watching them and thus were programmed to choose advertisements that would maximise their advertising potential. For example, if three women in their twenties, one woman in her fifties and two men in their forties were within eyeshot of the bilboard (and specifically paying at least some attention to it) the bilboard would choose ads that targeted the younger women as that would be considered more cost-efficient than choosing ads that would target all of the demographics together. Her team had written the programs that analysed the bilboard\'s audience and then calculated which ads to play, as well as recording the information, sending it back to Magnuson and automatically billing the companies whose services were advertised based on how long their ads were visible and how many people saw them. Conversion rates further on down the line were also calculated - however her team hadn\'t been involved with that work - the marketing company they had worked for, Magnuson, had hired its own programmers in-house to do that, as the specifics of the algorithms that calculated conversion rates relied on data that was considered too top-secret to reveal to anyone, let alone her team. If competing marketing companies got hold of the data it could be disastrous to Magnuson and apparently there was quite a high price on the information, too. Magnuson had probably done the right thing keeping it under lock and key, in her opinion. If she had been offered twenty million for backdoor access to the data she didn\'t know if she could have maintained her integrity. \r\n\r\n\"About as complicated as any other,\" she told him. Magnuson had forced her and her team to sign strict non-disclosure agreements which meant that she could tell people she had programmed the bilboards but not the exact nature of how they worked. \r\nThey finished their coffees by 8.56 and noted to each other that the trains were still running late and the platform was still overcrowded. He pulled out his phone and played with it for a moment, looking something up, deep in thought. She took the time to examine his left hand - no ring finger. She wondered if he was single. Probably not - he was quite the catch. It was just her luck really to meet someone so perfect and have him not be available. \r\n\r\nHe looked up from his phone a moment later. \"If you don\'t mind walking a kilometre or so, there\'s a bus we can catch…\" He watched her hopefully. \r\n\"A bus?\" She was uncertain. It had been a long time since she had taken a bus. \r\n\"Come on, it\'ll be quaint,\" he says. \"It\'ll take us where we need to go - it\'ll take a bit longer, of course, but really if you think about it we could be waiting a while anyway. At least this way we get to take our respective fates into our own hands.\"\r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t help but like him then and she suspected that she agreed to walk a kilometre in uncomfortable shoes in order to take an outdated  mode of transport into work simply in order to get the chance to spend more time with him. \r\n\r\nAfter they had dropped their fares into the bus driver\'s hand she went to take a seat at the front of the almost empty bus. \r\n\"Oh, no,\" he chided her, \"if you\'re committed to taking a bus then you must commit to sitting at the very back. Only then can you fully appreciate the experience.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a few minutes she knew exactly what he had meant by that. As they traversed the steep hills of the bus route the suspension at the back of the bus gently bounced them up and down, causing happy little bubbles of joy to pop in their bellies. They looked at each other each time they bounced and laughed in embarressment at how much they, grown adults, were enjoying it. \r\n\r\nThey chatted about hobbies and interests - he was a budding novelist, she an avid reader. She liked painting and drawing, he appreciated the arts. They had both taken a vow to stop watching TV although she hadn\'t admitted to him that she often cheated. They both liked fine wine and dining (who didn\'t, though). They both despised the beach, preferring instead to spend time in forests and at lakes for holidays. \r\n\r\nWhen finally they got into the city she was reluctant to leave him; she reminded herself that he had her details and was going to send her a copy of his publication. \"I had fun,\" he told her.\r\n\"We\'re so very late,\" she said, checking her watch. \"But I had fun too. Thanks for convincing me to take the bus.\"\r\n\"Any time,\" he answered. \"Well, I have to go now. I\'ll send you a copy of The Defiant Whimsy. Hey, I\'ll even sign it!\"\r\nShe laughed at his silly joke. \"Alright Peter. Take care.\" \r\n\"You too, Ella. Bye.\"\r\n\r\nAnd just like that, it was over. She was so pleased, though, so taken with him, that she almost floated into work. Her thoughts were filled with him - how he smiled, the sound of his voice, how his aftershave smelled. When asked why she was so late she smiled as she told of the late trains. People looked at her quizzically; usually late trains made her angry - none the less, they let her strange behaviour go. Later she chastised herself for not asking if he was single. It was a question that burned away at her all day. Half the time she told herself, of course he was; he\'d been flirting with her, after all. Then the other half she told herself not to be so desperate and foolish. All the good men were already taken, and happily so. ',2292,'chapter'),(55,36,'1','Ella goes on a bad date.','Dating','2016-04-03 03:16:41','2016-04-03 03:16:41','She stood in front of the bathroom mirror playing with her hair, trying to decide if she should wear it up or down. To wear it down was always preferable; a woman of her age had to go to extra pains to look feminine, and long, flowing locks achieved that end quite well. However, a modern woman sometimes naturally preferred to wear her hair up, especially on hot or windy days or, as was the case today, when she had been detained at the office for an extra couple of hours and hadn’t had enough time when she had come home to wash and blow dry her hair.\r\n\r\nUp. She would wear it up. To hell with femininity - she didn’t have time for it today. \r\n\r\nShe was quite certain, anyway, that this date would be just as disappointing as every other date she had been on this year. Since she had hit thirty, things had started to go downhill. She used to get hundreds of responses from men on dating sites when she was in her late twenties - and many of those were from eligible men of her own age. When choosing a date she had been able to make a choice based on a variety of factors - how fit the man was, how intelligent he was, how handsome. How much they had in common. How in sync they were conversationally.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it was a completely different story. She was lucky, if she stayed online for a whole evening, to get maybe ten men responding favourably to her profile. \r\n\r\nOf those ten, two of those were bound to be men ten years younger than her who were looking for a \'cougar\' or a \'milf\', and at least another two were bound to be men of fifty or sixty trying to push their luck. \r\n\r\nAs for the rest, well, Ella found these days that many men were \'not looking for anything serious\' and the ones who were looking for something serious were either \'still living at home with their parents,\' \'between jobs,\' or else, and Ella would never, ever admit this to another living soul, they were just plain unattractive and/or incredibly stupid. \r\n\r\nThe men she wanted simply weren\'t clicking on her profile. The men she wanted - the ones who went to the gym or played a sport and actually cared about their appearance, the ones who went out and got fashionable haircuts and went to the trouble to wear nice clothes, the ones who were intelligent, articulate and had a good sense of humour, those men wanted women in their twenties. \r\n\r\nAnd Ella couldn\'t get a look in. \r\n\r\nShe slipped on her shoes. The guy she was meeting tonight was what Ella liked to think of as an \'outlier\' - a dating anomaly. Sometimes an eligible man - attractive, intelligent, thin, living on his own and employed - slipped through the cracks for one reason or another. Maybe he lived in an area where there were no women in their twenties available, and so was forced to settle for someone his own age; or maybe he had just been burnt badly by a younger woman who had used him for his connections or money and so was looking for someone safer, someone already established, mature; or maybe he had simply just gotten out of a long-term relationship and hadn\'t figured out yet that most men his age were going for younger models. In any case, Ella said yes to meeting this guy before validating that his personality was suitable, that he had a high enough IQ to hold a decent conversation, and that he wasn\'t an egomaniac - after all, she could always find those things out on the date, and she might not get the chance to go out on a date with another man her own age who had a job and didn\'t live with his parents and who didn\'t make babies cry when they caught sight of him. \r\n\r\nHe had chosen the restaurant, the date and the time. It was a Wednesday evening, the restaurant a little Italian place. Not too expensive, not too cheap. Not Friday night, either...\r\n\r\nShe sighed. Friday and Saturday nights were the worst. Sitting at home alone with her cat, watching some cookie cutter police procedural or some ridiculously contrived romantic comedy specially manufactured to sate her lonelines in between ads for hair dye and anti wrinkle cream. Look, those movies seemed to say, even Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz have trouble with men - and they\'re beautiful! So don\'t feel too bad! \r\n\r\nPfft, Ella would think to herself, as if they really had trouble with men in reality - they wouldn\'t have; not, at least, until they had finally hit the point at which botox and plastic surgery was on the whole ineffective, anyway. Only then could those women truly know what it was like for the average woman. Where were the romantic comedies starring women who actually looked their age, anyway? What would that even look like?\r\n\r\nWhenever an eligible man showed up to join in for the first time with the local Thursday evening Pool Competition she had signed up to, the other women there, also in their thirties and single, having become accostomed to staring at the less than impressive faces of the regular offerings, suddenly lost their cool and become drooling, giggling, sycophantic lunatics. They would loiter around the new guy like flies around a dung heap, either interrogating him with their endless questions or interrupting each other to talk non-stop in a nervous kind of excited tide of banality, as though he were even remotely interested. \r\n\r\nElla could tell by the look in his eyes that he was wondering what the hell was wrong with these women - were they so desperate that they always threw themselves in this way at the first decent guy to come along? Were they so starved for male attention, so unwanted, so discarded? \r\n\r\nAnd what must this kind of thing do for his own ego? Of course he would never return, thinking himself above every man there, and too good for every woman there, and so totally out of the league of the place. And the man would only really be average!\r\n\r\nIt was no romantic comedy, that was for sure; these women were not Jennifer Lopez with a wall of defiance born of pain, no Jennifer Aniston on the run from the law, no Carrie Bradshaw whimsically dating her way through Manhatten; they were just desperate, and lonely, and sad.\r\n\r\nElla wanted to shake these women, to wake them up, to yell at them - \"What are you doing? You\'re driving them away! For the love of God have some self respect. Or at least pretend, for crying out loud, if not for your own sakes, then for mine.\"\r\n\r\nShe poured extra kibble into the cat\'s feed bowl and left for the evening. They had decided to meet at the restaurant. It added that extra element of excitement for her - would he turn up at all? Would he turn up early and stake out a position at the bar so he could see her when she walked in? Would he quietly make an exit if she wasnt pretty enough? \r\n\r\nShe tried to push those thoughts aside as she entered her self-driving car and typed the location into the console. She was being neurotic. Most men, she knew, would stick the date out anyway, in the hopes of having sex later on. Men in the online dating scene would have sex with anyone who was willing, including women they weren\'t particularly attracted to, and women they actually actively despised. It was for precisely that reason that it was just about impossible these days for her to tell if a man actually liked her... Unless she gave in and slept with him. She simply couldn\'t trust men to end things if they didn\'t happen to like her; it was almost as if suffering through a personality they didn\'t enjoy was worth it in the end for them, and the sex was the ultimate act of revenge for all that suffering, and as soon as they obtained it they could finally show their real feelings towards a woman - whether love and affection, luke warm sentiments, cold indifference or actual palpable hatred. And if, at that point, the woman had happened to develop feelings for the seemingly nice, caring, supportive man she had spent all that time with, well - it took a long time for her to realise that that version of him was now gone forever. \r\n\r\nThe problem for her was that she didn\'t want to have to wait until she had sex with a man to find out if he actually secretly despised her, and it was such a pressing one that of late she had resorted to reading self helf books in the vain hope that they might magically offer up the answer to her. They lined her shelves like girl scout badges, having been read and collected and now left to gather dust. \r\n\r\nOne such book was titled \"Stop Being Such a Doormat for Crying Out Loud\". Its thesis was simply that women were giving men everything they wanted without getting what they needed in return. It advocated that women put off sex for several months and then right before they were about to do the deed bring out their list of demands which the man could then either accept or reject. Obviously if a man rejected these demands it not only meant that he wasn\'t going to get laid... It meant no relationship, and that meant that the woman would have to be prepared to walk. And if the man did decide to agree to her demands? Well, it was anyone\'s guess as to whether he would stand by the promises he had made. After all, if a man was willing to sleep with a woman he didn\'t even like, or wasn\'t even attracted to, why would he keep a promise to one? \r\n\r\nAnother book took those sentiments and then extended them a step further. \"Make Him Pay\" advocated treating men as dismally as possible for as long as possible by ignoring their calls, letting them know they were drastically unimportant and just generally taking advantage of them in every conceivable way. It failed to address the core issue though - that men often slept with women they despised anyway, so treating a man terribly just ensured that he might hate you with even more vigor later on.\r\n\r\nThe very last book she had read, the one which had put her off dating self help books for life, was called \"Stop Being Such a Selfish Bitch Already.\" In it the author suggested she put aside her own selfish needs and wants and focus on her date\'s selfish needs and wants instead. The book told her to  sleep with a man as soon as he wanted to, and above all, not to pester him about calling or showing any consideration, or try in any way to have him meet any of her needs. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, the advice from the last book would work - if the man in question genuinely liked her. If he didn\'t, well - it was simply a recipe for disaster. Once he realised he hated her, after having sex with her, he would simply use her to fulfil his needs until someone better came along, someone he didn\'t actually despise. Or someone younger. \r\n\r\nThe car pulled up to the restaurant. When she alighted it zoomed quietly off; it was programmed to find nearby parking and remain there until she summoned it again. \r\n\r\nThe restaurant seemed nice enough; the table linen and cutlery were clean, at least. She was seated by herself quite conspicuously in the middle of the dining area. If her date failed to show then escape for her would not be quiet and speedy - rather, it would be slow and humiliating. \r\n\r\nThe couple seated next to her were young and in love. They leaned across their table and kissed, making obnoxious sucking noises. The boy looked at his girlfriend with a mixture of desire and incredulity. How lucky he must feel, she thought, to have captured such a lovely creature. And her, so lucky to have such attention showered upon her, and not even having had to earn it in any discernible way - she simply had to look the way she did. She could have the personality of Hitler and he would be too blinded by her youthful beauty to even notice. She could have him executing traitors and he\'d happily do it. \r\n\r\nHer date arrived then, fifteen minutes late, flashing her the same kind of smile you might expect to see coming from the mouth of a used car salesman - only half genuine and tinged with a certain measure of desperation - hungry for a sale. He had clearly used an old photo of himself on his profile - he looked to be about ten years older than his profile claimed. Ella was rather disappointed. She simply didn\'t find him attractive - she was attracted to the ten years younger version of him, the one that was her own age. The one in the photograph. \r\n\r\nShe could see him eyeing her from head to toe - he was being rather obvious about it. It made her very uncomfortable. She coughed softly. His gaze shifted up to her eyes then and he grinned at her in a really odd, goofy way. She looked at her menu to escape his stare.  \r\nHe apologised for his tardiness. \"This place is a little further away than I thought it would be.\" \r\nShe smiled politely at him, but alarm bells were going off in her head. The guy had lied rather drastically about his age, and he had turned up late on a date that he had arranged himself. He really wasn\'t making a good impression on her so far. She couldn\'t wait to leave.\r\n\r\n\"Thats alright,\" she lied, her polite smike feeling very forced. \"I imagine it couldnt be helped?\" \r\nInstead of offering up a reasonable explanation he simply shrugged and shot her what she imagined that he thought was his most charming smile; unfortunately, charming smiles often failed to work their magic on Ella.\r\n\r\nBesdies, she believed that it wasn\'t that difficult to plan properly for a date, to leave early so as to be sure to arrive on time - and to call or text the person unfortunate enough to be left waiting for you if you knew you were going to be late. They lived in a society with self driving cars, after all, and the cars themselves ran like clockwork, even if society itself didn\'t (there was only ever roughly one mechanical error every ninety-two days). So there really was no excuse for lateness anymore apart from a lack of foresight, or pure laziness, two qualities she despised equally. \r\n\r\nShe watched as he took his seat and got comfortable. Now the awkward part of the date would begin - they would attempt to reconcile the person sitting in front of them with the avatar they had texted with online for the last week or so. She tried to remember the details he had told her about himself - details that had ignited a few tentative sparks of hope in her heart. He was into skiing - good. Sporty. He played the drums. Great - creative. He had a six year old girl from a previous marriage - could be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you looked at it. \r\n\r\nThey ordered wines - these situations tended to go better with some social lubrication. \"So, Ellen, how was your day?\"\r\nShe sighed, inwardly scowling, outwardly tryng hard not to let her irriation show through. Her name was Ella, not Ellen. She supposed it wasn\'t too much of a mistake - he was kind of close, anyway.  \r\n\"Its Ella,\" she corrected him, and she watched his face for a reaction. He barely reacted at all, though - a real smooth customer, hardly missing a beat. \r\n\"Im sorry, Ella. Its been a real motherfucker of a day.\" \r\n Ella flinched. She hadn\'t been expecting swearing. It seemed a bit too hard and jagged for the occasion. \"Why has your day been so bad?\" \r\n\"Oh, you know, just work and stuff. Dont worry babe - Im not gonna let it ruin our night.\" \r\nShe clenched her teeth. Babe? Really?\r\n\"Should we order?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. She could already see that they weren\'t going to get very far into the meal before she got up and left him there. She just knew that he wasn\'t the guy she wanted - she had been on more than enough dates to be able to determine that kind of thing very early on at this point - and she wasn\'t going to waste a whole meal, or even half of one. She would give him another chance, get to know him a little bit more, and give her car time to find its way back to the restaurant (she had summoned it using the app on her phone discreetly as her date had been looking at his menu), but she was ninety-nine percent certain that she nothing he said would make any difference.\r\n \r\n\"Let\'s chat for a bit, yeah? What do you think?\"\r\n\"Okay,\" he replied. \"So Ella… How long have you been single?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a question men always asked, along with do you live alone and how many cats do you own.\r\n\r\n\"Several months. Yourself?\" \r\n\r\nIt was a complete lie, of course. In actual fact it had been three years. When she told men that they would ask why it had been so long. And the answer to that question was rather complicated and not the kind of subject best discussed on a good first date. She found that lying and making it too short an amount of time wasn\'t good either - they would get the idea she was good for a short term fling, someone who didn\'t really get overly involved - and she certainly didn\'t want to give them that idea either. \r\n\r\n\"A few weeks.\" \r\n\r\nThe men that the dating app matched her with didn\'t seem to need a period of mourning over their last relationship - they tended to move on rather quickly. It was a fact that often disturbed her. Whenever she ended a relationship, even one that had only lasted a few months (which, at this point, was usually the amount of time they did end up lasting) she still needed time to adjust to being single again, to being lonely, to being rejected, unwanted - for that to feel normal again. The men she dated, on the other hand, didn\'t seem to bat an eyelid over it - they wanted to get back on that horse as quickly as possible. It astounded her. \r\n\r\n\"That\'s not very long, John,\" she said. \r\nHe shrugged. \"It was just a fling.\"\r\n\r\nThat was another thing - these men that she was matched with - every one of them - seemed to be the \'flinging\' type rather than the \'sticking\' type. To her, being in a three month fling was something to be embarrassed about, something to be ashamed of - and she was usually the last to know that that was what she was in fact in. That sinking feeling she would get in the pit of her stomach when she realised the guy she was dating hadn\'t been looking at the bigger picture like she had… He hadn\'t been thinking of the future like she had… She had been picturing picket fences, joint mortgages and children, while he had been picturing doggy style, head jobs and sex outdoors. And just when she had started to feel comfortable, to feel that yes, this time, it actually might happen for her, this time a guy might actually stick around long enough to provide her with these things… That was about the time when they started to pull back, to fade away into the night like a timid ghost.  \r\n\r\nShe would call and text; they would ignore. She would worry and wonder; they would go on with their lives. Finally, after a month or so of being ignored, they might call again, ask to \'catch up\', ask if she wanted to \'come over\' and \'hang out\' at 10pm at night, and only then, when she turned up on their doorstep, tears streaming down her face, a crazy, wild look in her eyes, questions pouring out of her mouth, only then would they finally come clean to her - what do you mean, Ella, you were thinking of us living together? Of us getting married, one day having children? You were thinking that far ahead? Seriously Ella, I was still trying to figure out whether I liked you or not… As for you being the mother of my children, well, geez, that\'s a bit much… \r\n\r\nWHAT??!!!?!! Ella would think to herself. After all that wooing, after all that chasing, after all that acting needy and posessive in the beginning… After all of that, now you tell me you didn\'t even want me? Didn\'t even see a future with me? What the hell???\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath, a sip of her wine and forced herself to relax. \"I see,\" she replied. \r\n\r\nHe laughed, flashed her a charming smile. At least he was perceptive enough to know she wasn\'t impressed. \"Hey, she knew it was a fling. We both went into it with our eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nThe men she had dated had given her warning signs along the way - hell, some of them had even told her they weren\'t \'ready\' for a \'long term thing\'; the problem was that wonderful beginning stage, that stage of utter euphoria, like the stage those kids at the table next to them were in - the stage where he looked at her with stars in his eyes, adored her, cherished her, kissed the ground she walked on. Forgetting those wonderful beginnings was damn hard - even when the current reality of the relationship was repeatedly smacking her square in the face. It was near impossible to believe that someone so caring, so thoughtful and wonderful could turn so cold in a matter of weeks. \r\n\r\nWhen they would start to tell her that they were hanging out with their friends that Friday night, also that Saturday; when suddenly they didn\'t want to be with her all the time anymore, she knew it was the beginning of the end. Suddenly her text messages would go unanswered. Suddenly there were no date nights anymore - only streaming video and cuddling on the couch. Suddenly all those things she had wanted them to do as a couple - going to markets, walks in the park, etc - suddenly they were things they would do \'next weekend\' - only next weekend never came. Suddenly even waiting until she had come was too much effort for them. Suddenly the things she had come to expect were now her acting \'needy\' and \'over entitled\' - where before they had just been givens. She in fact HAD been entitled to them in his eyes up until then. \r\n\r\nShe gulped down the rest of her wine, blinked a few times. Back to reality. She stared at the man in front of her. How might he hurt her? Was he the blissfully ignorant type? An emotional blackmailer? Selfish and self-absorbed beyond repair? Or was he wilfully indignant and aggressive? Vindictive and poisonous? Who could tell? \r\n\r\nAll she knew was that his true nature would take a few months to finally rise to the surface and make itself known. She found this thought hilariously funny and laughed out loud for several seconds. Perhaps the wine had gone to her head.\r\n\r\n\"Ella? What are you laughing at?\" \r\n\"Nothing, John. Nothing. Hey, you know what, I just realised, I forgot to feed my cat! Can you believe that?\"\r\nThe charming smile faded from his face. \"You\'re kidding, right?\"\r\n\"No. I\'m so sorry.\" His smile was replaced with a cold, hard stare. \"You\'re fucking kidding me!\" \r\n\r\nVindictive. Phew! She had dodged a bullet. Out of the corner of her eye she could see her car pulling up into the parking bay just outside the restaurant - the one that was reserved for self-driving car pickups. \r\n\r\n\"I\'m going home now.\" She rose from the table and collected her bag. \"My car\'s outside. It was nice meeting you. Have a nice evening!\"\r\nHe rose as she rose and opened his mouth to say something; he looked confused, disbelieving; but she simply left him standing there, power walking to the door of the restuarant and quickly slipping out into the refreshing night air. \r\n\r\nAt least she could eat what she really wanted now - Italian food made her feel bloated. \r\n\r\nShe was aware of the fact that she had grown rather selfish in her extended state of singledom, and especially since she\'d hit her thirties - she was much less yielding now, so much less willing to accept less than she wanted - but she felt that most single men her age and older were already more selfish than she was anyway, and she could only really be considered selfish in comparison to men and women in stable relationships. Especially women in relationships - those who gave themselves over to men completely, women who sacrificed everything for their children - which Ella could understand. Given the right man and the right circumstances, she would do the same. But the fact was if you compared Ella to single men her age and older, you would actually find her less selfish, or at worst, as selfish as. \r\n\r\nAnd she wasn\'t at all disturbed that fact. Why were men allowed to be so selfish anyway, while women were rebuked for it? Why were men allowed to be messy while women had to be clean? Why were men allowed to be aggressive in their demands and desires, and women had to be timid and meek and mild? And why were men encouraged to give into their every base desire while women were encouraged to suppress theirs?\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t seem at all fair. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe next night ​Ella met Deborah at The Welsh Inn for the annual Valentine\'s Day Singles Mixer.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately they ran into a woman they had gone to school with - Sylvia Summers - who had been the House Captain. She commiserated with them over being single in her thirties.\r\n\"Isn\'t it awful? Where have all the good men gone?\" \r\nDeborah smiled at her but then turned and rolled her eyes secretly to Ella. Ella ignored it. Sylvia was right - and Deborah had this awful tendency to ignore the truth in front of her. \r\n\"I\'m used to being single,\" Ella told her. \"It\'s actually not that bad. I have no one telling me what to do, when to do it; no one to clean up after. Except my cat.\"\r\nDeborah piped up then. \"I have a fuck buddy,\" she boasted. Sylvia smiled politely at Deborah and then gave Ella a knowing glance. Ella stayed quiet. She imagined Sylvia was thinking what she was thinking - who would want a fuck buddy when they could have a meaningful relationship with someone they respected? It was pointless. Ella simply didn\'t have the time nor the energy to have sex with someone she didn\'t like all that much.  \r\nSylvia had grown up to become a real estate agent and as such had cards printed that featured her face on them in colour. She once again brought up the seeming drought of decent single men their own age and then she joked that often she met men at parties like this one, but after getting her number they often forgot to call. She laughed and said, \"Perhaps they forget who I am, what I look like?\" \r\nDeborah looked at the business card she had just been handed. \"Give them your card so they remember your face, then.\"\r\nShe laughed. \"I actually have started doing just that, can you believe it?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Deborah and Ella moved away, Deborah poked Ella in the ribs with her elbow. \"Can you believe it? She\'s so desperate that she hands men a card with a picture of her face on it so they don\'t forget what she looks like!\" She laughed hysterically. Ella sighed and looked away. Deborah was then distracted by a man a few years younger than them - the best looking man in the whole bar. \"Look at him. Should we go up and talk to him?\"\r\nElla cringed inwardly. There was no way they even had half a chance with that guy. She wondered why Deborah was so naive, so ignorant of reality. Then she realised Deborah probably simply hadn\'t had the balls to test it yet.\r\n\"Go over there and talk to him,\" she goaded. \r\nDeborah suddenly grew timid. \"Nah.\"\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\nDeborah shrugged. She sipped at her cocktail, her eyes never leaving his form. \r\n\r\nA man in his late forties sidled up to Ella then. His face was kind of goofy looking - it was rather long, and he had buck teeth and the suit he was wearing looked old and worn and didn\'t quite fit him very well - the sleeves were a little too long, and the shoes were of a style that Ella remembered was popular several years ago. When she asked him what he did he simply told her he was self-employed. \r\n\"What do you do while you work for yourself, then?\"\r\n\"I\'m in finance,\" he replied a little cagily, his glance moving around the room. \r\n\"What kind of finance?\" Ella waited to hear him explain - but he didn\'t. Instead he changed the topic. \"What\'s a lovely lady like you doing in a place like this?\"\r\n\r\nClearly he was ashamed of whatever it was he did - or maybe what he didn\'t do - and she had no time to entertain him (she didn\'t like him that much anyway) so she said, \"Excuse me, I have to text someone,\" and then she turned around so that he could face her shoulder. She hoped he would take the hint and go away; and eventually, he did. \r\n\r\nDeborah. who bore witness to the whole thing, looked at her with a shocked expression. \r\n\"Why didn\'t you like that guy?\" Her voice, though sounding shocked, had a slightly hard edge to it.\r\nElla sighed. She wanted to explain to Deborah but simply didn\'t have the patience. \"He wasn\'t my type.\"\r\n\"Why?\" Deborah leveled a hard stare at Ella. Ella shifted her weight slightly away from Deborah. It was too complicated to explain and she didn\'t feel she had to, anyway. What business was it of Deborah\'s anyway? She felt that Deborah was just annoyed that no one was approaching her. \r\n\"I\'d prefer someone my own age,\" Ella replied. A moment\'s silence passed tensely between them. \"I would have thought that wasn\'t too much to ask,\" she added.\r\n\"Maybe you could lower your standards,\" Deborah suggested. \r\nElla suppressed a wry laugh. \"I don\'t think so.\"\r\n\"Well you could have politely told him you weren\'t interested,\" she said indignantly. Ella wanted to smack her. The last time she had tried to do that with a man he had barked at her, \"Hey, lady, I wasn\'t that into you anyway! You stupid stuck up bitch!\" She didn\'t want to have to go through that again. But she couldn\'t be bothered explaining it to Deborah.\r\n\r\nDeborah looked around the bar, her gaze lingering on the man she had been yearning after for a while now. He was surrounded by four women at this point. They were cosying up to him, touching him, laughing appreciatively at his jokes. He was laughing along with them too, a rooster in a hen house. \r\n\"Damn. Looks like I missed my chance.\"\r\n\"Maybe you should lower your standards,\" Ella said. Deborah looked sheepish. \"Touche.\" She swigged the rest of her drink in one go. \"I think I might leave. This is a bit depressing.\"\r\n\"Yes,\" Ella agreed. \"It is a little.\"\r\n\"Do you want to walk to the station with me?\"\r\nElla shook her head. \"No.\" She hadn\'t had enough social interaction for the evening - she wanted to talk to new people, people who wouldn\'t insult her by telling her she should settle. \r\n\"I\'ll see you on Monday.\"\r\n\"Okay then,\" Deborah replied. \"Bye.\"\r\n\r\nElla went to the bar to order a cocktail. She perused the menu looking for the most ridiculous one she could find. After she ordered it she sipped at it slowly, assessing the throng of people still at the venue. Her thoughts wandered back to her ex boyfriend.\r\n\r\nHe had seemed like a good choice. He had a good job, a nice apartment - his life had seemed together when they had first started dating, which was good. She wasn\'t all that attracted to him, though - he was overweight and in denial about it. Ella couldn\'t pretend she adored the rolls of pimply white fat that were his torso, try as she might. But that\'s what he had wanted her to do.\r\n\r\nElla had respected him, admired him, adored being with him and talking to him, but she just wasn\'t sexually attracted to him. That hadn\'t stopped them from having sex - it had been slightly lack lustre sex on her part - which he had complained about, but in her mind, they had ended up connecting on a deeper level anyway. \r\n\r\nAt least she had thought so. Things hadn\'t really worked out. He had ended up dumping her anyway, just like all the rest. \r\n\r\nSo in her experience settling wasn\'t a good option either.\r\n\r\nA man stepped up to the bar then to order a drink. He looked sideways at her cocktail. \"What on earth is that?\"\r\nElla laughed. \"It\'s called a Fruit Tingle.\"\r\nHe laughed too. \"It looks... Colourful. Does it taste good?\"\r\n\"It\'s wonderful,\" she replied. \"And what are you having?\"\r\nHe answered, \"Just beer, I\'m afraid.\" He smiled at her. She smiled back. She was about to think of something else to say, but just then two twenty-two year olds sidled up to the bar on his other side. His gaze was magnetized to their cleavage, the high hems of their short skirts. He turned away from her and began to chat to them. \r\nShe sighed. It would hurt if it were the first time it had happened. Unfortunately, it was becoming a common occurrence. \r\n\r\nShe had almost finished her cocktail when the two twenty-two year olds had decided they were bored with the man next to her and left the bar. He turned back to her, a smitten smile still lingering on his face. Then his eyes focused back on her thirty-something year old face. His smile faded a little. He said, \"Oh, you\'ve nearly finished it?\" His didn\'t even wait for her to answer; already his eyes were scanning the crowd, eagerly seeking out newer, younger faces to bestow his gaze upon. She didn\'t bother answering. Instead she finished her cocktail and left. \r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t worth settling, but nor was it worth being a consolation prize, either. \r\n\r\nWhen she arrived home later that night she decided that it wasn\'t even worth pursuing a relationship at this point. She decided to save herself the hassle and just give up.',5948,'chapter'),(58,36,'4','The Magnusson people have called an impromptu meeting - they have another project for Ella\'s company','Werk','2016-05-02 03:20:44','2016-05-02 03:20:44','When she arrived at the office, she saw two reps from Magnusson through the large interior glass windows of meeting room 2. The senior of the two was a woman in her forties named Sue. She was impeccably dressed, as always, a real power player. The attractive, suave man in his twenties seated next to her was Sam. Ella had spoken to the both of them on a regular basis while working on the bilboards project.\r\n\r\nShe felt a sudden jolt of fear course through her body as she wondered whether they were there that day because they somehow knew about her conversation with Peter. Perhaps they knew that she had told him that her team had worked on the billboards. Perhaps they were there to suggest to her boss Bill that she be fired for breaking the non disclosure agreement. However, her thoughts were put to rest when she spotted them looking at her through the glass windows, waving and smiling at her in an exceedingly friendly manner. They didn\'t seem as though they were there to admonish her for breaking the agreement.\r\n\r\nBill intercepted her in the hallway on her way to the coffee room.\r\n\"Where have you been, Ella? The Magnusson people are here. They called an impromptu meeting - they\'re thinking about offering us another project! They want to discuss the details with the higher-ups - you, me, Craig and John.\"\r\n\"I\'m so sorry I\'m late, Bill,\" she gushed. \"The trains were running late so I decided to catch the bus - and that turned out to be a mistake.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt incredibly guilty for telling Bill this half-truth. Part of her guilt was caused by the fact that she still felt as though she was floating along the ground effortlessly after having met Peter that day, such a sense of lightness and ease in her footsteps that day. It had been worth it being late for work just to have met him, even if the Magnusson reps and her bosses ended up being mad at her. \r\n\r\nBut Bill wasn\'t mad - he simply smiled reassuringly at her. \"It\'s alright, Ella. I know you wouldn\'t have been late if you could possibly help it. Just go grab yourself a coffee and then come and join us in meeting room 2 when you\'re ready and we\'ll start.\"\r\n\r\nSue smiled broadly at her as she entered meeting room 2. Her young sidekick smiled at her too. His smile was the perfect mix of friendliness and professional respect. She imagined he had practiced that smile in front of the mirror for hours to get it just right. \r\n\r\nAs Ella took a seat in between Bill and Craig, the quality assurance manager, everyone in the room exchanged pleasantries. When they were all done, Sue filled everyone in on her reasons for calling the meeting. \r\n\r\n\"We were so impressed with the work your team did on the bilboards project that we were thinking of giving you something else, something a little more involved this time.\" She paused to guage their responses. John, the senior manager of the  company, looked at Bill with the pleasantly surprised expression of a person who has just found a hundred dollar note in front of him on the footpath. To work with the Magnusson Corporation once was quite fortunate, but to have the opportunity to work with them again was a God-send. Their projects were challenging, large-scale and extremely well-paying. \r\n\r\nJohn attempted to remain poker faced but failed. As he turned back to look at Sue, a cheshire cat-like grin was threatening to overtake his face. He struggled to sound casual. \"I think we could probably accomodate you again.\"\r\n\"So this is something your in-house development team can\'t handle themselves then, I take it?\" Bill inquired. \r\nIt was Sue\'s young associate Sam who replied, \"We usually would get them to handle a project of this magnitude, but lately we\'ve been having some issues -\"\r\n\"We were so impressed with the way your team handled the billboard project that we thought we\'d give you a crack at this one,\" Sue quickly cut her associate off. She shot him a disapproving look. \"We\'d like to give you some specs and get a detailed proposal from you as soon as possible. What do you all think?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Ella then, smiling in a knowing sort of way. Ella smiled unsurely back at her. She wondered if Sue was just happy to have another woman present. The two of them weren\'t particularly close and she wasn\'t the decision maker in the room - John and Bill were. But the woman was watching her specifically, waiting for her to say something, so she did. \r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\"\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Sue said, not waiting to hear from anyone else. \"We look forward to seeing your proposal soon.\"\r\n\"Before we go,\" Sam added, \"I just wanted to let you know that this time you guys will have access to some pretty sensitive data. We\'ll actually need you to sign some contracts from our lawyers before you even take a look at the preliminary specs. Is that okay?\"\r\n\r\nBill stared questioningly at Sam for a minute. Ella imagined that he, just like her, was wondering whether the Magnusson Corporation was finally going to share some of their precious insider secrets with them. She felt a little anxious but excited at the same time. Finally Bill replied, \"Sure. No problem. Send them over.\"',908,'chapter'),(59,36,'5','Bill tells Ella that if they do well on this project, he will be the new GM and she will take over his position. Instead of feeling excited Ella feels something else...','Promotion','2016-05-02 03:23:22','2016-05-02 03:23:22','\"If we do well on this project Ella...\"\r\n\r\nBill let his voice trail off as he looked down at his fingers as they fiddled nervously with a pen on his desk. His lips curled into a hesitant, conspiratorial sort of smile as he looked up to meet her gaze again. \r\n\r\n\"John is thinking of retiring soon - in the next couple of years, actually. I\'m betting this new Magnusson thing will take around that long to finish. Anyways, if we do really well with it, I\'ll end up being the new general manager, and that will leave my job open for someone else...\"\r\n\r\nElla realised then that he must have had the same talk with Craig earlier and now it was simply her turn. Craig had, after all, been with the company for eight years - Ella had only been there for six. Craig had originally held the project manager position she now held but had opted to take over the QA manager position when the previous one had been suddenly and unexpectedly deported. Ella had been hired as Craig\'s replacement.\r\n\r\nShe blinked as she noticed Bill\'s attention on her - he had, in fact, been watching her for the last half a minute or so to gauge her reaction to his words. She found herself laughing nervously under his scrutiny. \r\n\r\n\"I guess Craig and I are in competition then?\"\r\n\r\nBill shook his head, his eyes indicating a hint of surprised confusion. \"No way, Ella. While it\'s certainly true that Craig has been here longer and therefore has a little seniority over you, honestly... You are worth three of him.\"\r\n\r\nElla felt a sudden wave of some overpowering emotion take hold of her and wash over her from head to toe. She suddenly felt faint. Soon her head was swimming from the unexpected praise and she even began to blush for the first time in years. But just as quickly she began to feel something else... It was difficult to pinpoint... Guilt? Shame? She wasn\'t sure exactly what it was, and she had no idea what the source of it was, but it began to pool annoyingly at the corners of her eyes, uncomfortably welling in tears which threatened to betray her at any moment and embarrass her further. \r\n\r\nBill smiled kindly at her. \"Today is the first time I can ever recall you being late to work. But that\'s really the least of it. You\'re so dedicated... You\'ve really given your absolute all for this role, for this company. But more than anything else...\" He regarded her as he smiled and leaned back in his swivel chair, crossing his thick arms over his chest. \"I can just see you still being here in five - hell, maybe even ten year\'s time.\"\r\n\r\nHis words were like a hearty and well-meant yet completely overdone slap on the back, meant to be reassuring and kind, but more jarring and painful. She knew that the effect of them was meant to be pride; however, she felt even sadder than she had just a moment ago, and that un-nameable feeling that had overtaken her pride continued to amplify. She nodded at him, forcing a smile, keeping her eyes wide open like a character in an anime film in order to keep the tears from spilling out. \"Thank you so much, Bill. I really appreciate that.\" \r\n\r\nHe nodded, apparently not noticing her strange facial expression nor the tears. \"I should let you get back to it I guess. If you could just sign the contracts before you go, I\'ll have some papers ready for you to take home tonight - oh, you don\'t mind working some overtime, do you? I really want to have a plan ready for Sue ASAP. Is that okay?\"\r\n\"Sure!\" Her answer was over-bright but he didn\'t notice. His head was busy with visions of the future where he was the new general manager. She signed the contracts and left, heading for the bathroom to fix her eyes and makeup. Back at her desk she busied herself with work for the rest of the day, piling it over her feelings and effectively burying them.

One sat atop a box - $72! - he was a little racoon looking fellow, and when you picked him up you could feel the workmanship that went into making him. His joints moved and he was heavy, yet fragile. His fur was meticulously soft and perfectly placed... I wanted so badly to buy it; I thought it was the perfect gift. He was a collectible, he would probably be gone in a year or so, replaced with newer designs. But an overwhelming sadness overcame me as I realised how delicate, fragile and cute he was, and how rough and neglectful my mother tended to be with such creatures. I could just imagine her leaving him out in direct sunlight to fade, or spilling coke or coffee all over him. I could imagine her cat chewing him to bits, her birds leaving their droppings all over him. Or perhaps he would sit on top of a shelf high up and gather dust. Worst of all, and probably the most likely scenario, would be that she would simply throw him out one day, having no use for him anymore and not being able to see past her own self absorbed oblivion that he was so rare, fragile and valuable. No. The gift isn\'t the teddy bear - it\'s a symbol - of my love, and if she saw fit to throw him away or let him get mangled and ruined, then that was what she was willing to let happen to my love, and I was sick of it, sick of enduring it, of weathering it. She would recieve something befitting - something cheap and plastic, something gaudy and colourful, glittery but ultimately meaningless. Then she could do what she wanted with it and it wouldn\'t matter.

His skull had been partially crushed - his head was on its side, and it looked as though he had an ear to the ground, listening intently, except that only one eye, one ear and half a mouth remained intact on his face. \r\n\r\nQuite a bit of blood was now pooling around his body, filling the cracks in the sidewalk before slowly expanding outwards. \r\n\r\nElla was beside herself. She alternated between standing above him and staring disbelievingly down at him, desperately willing him to get up, and crouching down beside him to reach a hand out to gingerly touch his soft, sandy coloured hair. How she loved to stroke his hair as he lay his head on her shoulder or leaned in to kiss her. \r\n\r\nShe sobbed uncontrollably. Reality was setting in. He was the love of her life. It had taken her 35 years to find him and now he was gone. Just like that. \r\n\r\nA security guard suddenly appeared. He had been drawn out into the night from his rounds inside by the alarm of Ella\'s frantic wailing. When he saw the body up close he involuntarily let out a sickened cry.

When it had settled he spoke into his radio.\r\n\"Aashir, someone\'s jumped from the top of the buliding. You better call the police.... Christ.

She stared up at the building where she worked, at its many shiny, soul-less window eyes that seemed to glare right back at her, as if watching her every move. She looked back at Drew. Her shaking began to take  on a violent quality.
